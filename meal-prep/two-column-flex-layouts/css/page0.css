/*
    In this demo, we're going to showcase three different
    two column layouts using flexbox, that you could 
    potentially use for a web page.

    The first will be a two column layout with equally
    sized columns, and the latter two are layouts with 
    sidebars, one on the left, and one on the right.

    It's (still) important to have your HTML set up 
    properly before writing a single line of CSS
    when it comes to setting up a page layout.

    Containers are an important part of any page layout,
    but the container for this particular demo is 
    going to be particularly important, since we're
    going to turn it into a flexbox.

    So first, we'll set up our HTML, with a single 
    large container that'll become the flexbox, 
    and inside of that, two smaller containers:
    one for our sidebar content, and one for our
    main content.

    In the sidebar content, we'll add a heading
    and a list with some links in it.

    In the main content, we'll add a couple
    headings and some paragraphs as well.
