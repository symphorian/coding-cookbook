/* Drill 3 - Write your code solution below */

/*
    Now we're getting a little creative, 
    showing how we can use borders on a single
    side in order to replicate something like
    a horizontal rule (<hr>) element.

    This should hopefully make them think back
    to the Wiki Page assignments, where they had
    to use <hr> elements under the headings,
    which didn't look quite the same as the
    actual page.

    Now, with this appropach we have control
    over the width, line type, and color 
    (the padding as well, but this drill set
    isn't about padding).
