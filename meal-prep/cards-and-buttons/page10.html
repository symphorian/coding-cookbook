                Like before, we can copy our cards and past 
                two more after them. This should generate two 
                additional cards in a second row beneath our 
                first set of cards.

                The .card styles we added will effect these cards 
                as well, which is why we won't have to touch 
                the css much after pasting them.

                Now let's also go ahead an change their img 
                src and alt attributes as well as the titles,
                just to add a bit more variety.

                ...but now, our cards don't look too good.
                They're all smooshed together.  We have one
                last bit of CSS to write to clean things up
                before we wrap up!
