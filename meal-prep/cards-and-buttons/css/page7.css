        Now, let's also add a nice, subtle gradient 
        to it to make it appear as if it has a shiny 
        texture.

        We're going to be using the background property 
        and the linear-gradient value for this.

        The background property is a shorthand CSS 
        property that can set all sorts of background
        related properties.

        The linear-gradient is a css function that creates 
        an 'image' consisting of a progressive transition 
        between two or more colors along a straight line. 
        In otherwords, it makes a linear gradient. 

        The syntax for linear-gradients looks a little
        weird: you specify the function name (linear-gradient)
        followed by open/close parentheses.

        Then inside of the open/close parentheses, you 
        specify the inputs to the function, similar to 
        how you specify the values of normal CSS Properties.

        The most basic type of linear gradient is two
        color values separated by a comma.  If you want
        additional colors, you can add them, as long as
        you separate them with commas.

        However, you can also specify a direction as the 
        first input to the linear-gradient function; this 
        will tell the function in what direction you want
        the color change to start and where you want it
        to go. This direction can be in degrees, or using 
        directional keywords like "to top left" or "to bottom".

        In this example, we're going to use degrees to 
        specify the direction of the gradient, along
        with three color values (in hex, though any valid
        CSS color value could work).
