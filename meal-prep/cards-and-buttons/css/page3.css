    Now let's make our anchor element stand out more 
    and look like a button.

    We'll target the .anchor-button class and give it 
    a display of block to have it strecth 100% of 
    its container's width. 
    
    Alternatively, if you don't wish to have it stretch,
    to the full width, you can also use inline-block
    instead, and set it to whatever width you prefer.

    Then let's stylize it by giving it a background-color, 
    color, removing the text-decoration, giving it a 
    font-weight of 'bold' and a font-size of 20px.

    Then, let's fix it's alignment by having the text-align 
    set to center and giving some padding to add some spacing 
    on the top and bottom of the content. We can also add 
    padding on the left/right of the content to give it a 
    minimum size.

    Now technically, our first card is done! 

    We have a very basic card layout with an image,
    title, content, and a call-to-action (CTA) button.

    However, at the moment, our card content doesn't 
    actually look much like a card...and our button
    doesn't really behave much like a button...
    
    So let's see how we can make  our fake button a 
    bit more interactive, and then we'll see how
    we can style our card to actually look a bit more
    like a card.
