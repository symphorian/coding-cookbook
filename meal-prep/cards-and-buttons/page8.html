                Let's highlight our card class div about along 
                with all of it's content, copy it, and then paste 
                what we've copied after it. This will create a 
                duplicate of our first card and you should now 
                see two identical cards.

                Now, let's make some necessary changes for our 
                second card, such as the image and title text.

                Now that we have two cards, I'm sure you've 
                noticed the glaring issue of the two cards 
                being attached at the hip. Like most spacing 
                issues, we can fix that with margin.
