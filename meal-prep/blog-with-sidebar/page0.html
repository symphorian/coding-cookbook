                    <p>
                        Hello? Hello, hello? Uh, I wanted to record a message 
                        for you to help you get settled in on your first night.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I'm 
                        finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact. 
                        So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I'm here 
                        to tell you there's nothing to worry about. Uh, you'll
                        do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through 
                        your first week.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Okay?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Uh, let's see, first there's an introductory greeting 
                        from the company that I'm supposed to read. Uh, it's 
                        kind of a legal thing, you know. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Um, "Welcome to 
                        Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. A magical place for kids and 
                        grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. 
                        Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to 
                        property or person. Upon discovering that damage or 
                        death has occurred, a missing person report will be 
                        filed within 90 days, or as soon property and premises 
                        have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the 
                        carpets have been replaced."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Blah, blah, blah. Now that might sound bad, I know, 
                        but there's really nothing to worry about. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Uh, the 
                        animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at 
                        night, but do I blame them? No. If I were forced to 
                        sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I 
                        never got a bath? I'd probably be a bit irritable at 
                        night too. 
                    </p>
                    <img 
                        src="images/fnaf_theband.png"

                    >
                    <p>
                        So, remember, these characters hold a 
                        special place in the hearts of children and we need 
                        to show them a little respect, right? Okay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander 
                        a bit. Uh, they're left in some kind of free roaming 
                        mode at night. Uh... Something about their servos 
                        locking up if they get turned off for too long. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Uh, 
                        they used to be allowed to walk around during the 
                        day too. But then there was The Bite of '87... 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yeah. 
                        I-It's amazing what the human body can do without 
                        the frontal lobe, you know?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Uh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to 
                        you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that 
                        these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after 
                        hours probably won't recognize you as a person. They'll 
                        pr- they'll most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton 
                        without its costume on. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now since that's against the 
                        rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably 
                        try to... forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear 
                        suit. 
                    </p>

                        src="images/fnaf_gameover.png"

                    >
                    <p>
                        Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad if the suits 
                        themselves weren't filled with crossbeams, wires, and 
                        animatronic devices, especially around the facial area. 
                        So, you could imagine how having your head forcefully 
                        pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of 
                        discomfort... and death. Uh, the only parts of you 
                        that would likely see the light of day again would 
                        be your eyeballs and teeth when they pop out the front 
                        of the mask, heh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Y-Yeah, they don't tell you these things when you 
                        sign up. But hey, first day should be a breeze. I'll 
                        chat with you tomorrow. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Uh, check those cameras, and 
                        remember to close the doors only if absolutely 
                        necessary. Gotta conserve power. Alright, good night.
