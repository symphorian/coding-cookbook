/*
    This demo is going to be a bit more dynamic
    than usual; we're going to be modifying 
    things quite a bit, showcasing different
    designs that could be applied to a navbar,
    as opposed to building multiple navbars.

    This maybe be a bit confusing to folks
    following the live demo, but be aware that
    the different navbars we'll be 
    building are also covered in the Layouts
    section of the Coding Cookbook.

    To start out, we'll use a pretty basic
    HTML structure of a div with anchors 
    inside.

    (There's a big debate about whether it's 
    better to include navigation items in 
    lists or not, but in the interest of 
    simplicity, we're not going to use lists)
