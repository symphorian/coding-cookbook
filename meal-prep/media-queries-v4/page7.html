                    I write short, fun articles about the
                    journeys I take as a photographer.

            Now, we're going to add our last chunk of HTML:
            to build a gallery using CSS Grid.
            
            First, let's create another div. We'll give this
            div a class of "featured".
         -->
         <div class="featured">
            <!--
                Then, let's add an h2 followed by one more 
                div with a class of "grid", in addition to that
                same "single-column-layout" class from before. 
                
                We're going to create an interesting grid 
                system that starts with 4 columns but condenses
                into fewer columns for responsiveness.
            -->
            <h2>Featured Photos</h2>
            <div class="single-column-layout grid">
                <!--
                    Inside, let's add a couple of paragraph 
                    elements with ids of "p1" and "p2" and 
                    add content like "Some of my favorite 
                    photos" and "Photography is fun!"

                    After the p elements, we'll add 4 image 
                    elements with ids of "img1", "img2",
                    "img3", and "img4".

                    Don't forget your alt attributes!
                -->
                <p id="p1">Some of my favorite photos</p>
                <p id="p2">Photography is fun!</p>
