/* Drill 2 - Write your code solution below */

/*
    Now, the exact same idea as the previous 
    drill, but there's no border or background
    color on the inner container, just text.

    Also, we're not giving equal padding on all
    sides: we're giving different values between
    the top/bottom and left/right sides.
