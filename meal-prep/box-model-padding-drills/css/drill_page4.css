/* Drill 4 - Write your code solution below */

/*
    The trick with this one is to remember that
    padding is additive.  There are multiple
    solutions to this one, but if you try
    to add padding to multiple containers
    and their padded sides meet, there's 
    likely going to be too much space in between
    them.

    The solution below adds padding on the 
    outer container, and then just on one side
    of one of the inner containers.
