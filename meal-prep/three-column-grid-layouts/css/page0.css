/*
    In this demo, we're going to showcase two different
    three column layouts using CSS grid; these two
    layouts are actually really similar, but they'll
    show that really it's just the CSS styling we use
    that makes them feel different.

    Since we're going with a three column layout, we
    need a bit more HTML set up before we get into 
    the CSS, mainly: 
    
    - a grid layout container
        - a sidebar column
        - a primary column
        - another sidebar column

    Note that each column has a div with an 
    "inner-content" class inside of it, and then we
    have the columns actual content inside of that
    (headings and links for sidebars, copy text
    for the primary column).

    That "inner-content" class will come in handy
    later for some interesting styling.
