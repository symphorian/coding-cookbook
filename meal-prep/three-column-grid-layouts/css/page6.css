    But we said we were going to show you
    two different layouts, and we still are!
    
    This second layout will use a modified
    grid, but we'll change that later; for the
    moment, we're just going to focus on the
    style changes.

    This second layout's style is going to be a
    bit of an inversion of the first one.

    We'll start by removing the color "bubble"
    from around the central content (well,
    really just commenting it out, so that
    students can still see what used to be
    there).

    Now we're going to apply a very similar
    style to apply those same color "bubbles" 
    to our sidebars, but since they're smaller,
    we won't round the corners quite so much.

    However, note that we're not applying them
    to the columns themselves, but to the 
    inner-content divs inside.

    If we applied this code to the columns, 
    we'd have the entire column colored, and
    we only want to apply the color to the
    content container inside the column
    (for this style, at least).

    There we go! Another relatively simple
    style for the layout, but gives it a 
    slightly different feeling, doesn't it?

    Now let's see what we can do to make 
    this layout more practical by modifying
    the grid.
