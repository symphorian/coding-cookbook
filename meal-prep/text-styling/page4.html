        <!--
            Call out how there is margin (space) between our paragraph 
            elements, similar to the heading (h1-h6) elements.  Most
            other HTML elements don't behave this way, as we'll see
            in a moment.

            Next, we're going to use the bold and italics elements; in the
            future, the students will learn better ways to style text in CSS,
            but for the moment, styling elements like these are enough.

            First we'll show them how they behave outside of a paragraph.

            Notice how they end up right next to each other.  That is because
            the bold and italics elements (and most of the other styling 
            elements) we'll learn today are "inline" elements, while the
            paragraph is a "block" element.

            We'll learn more about those terms in the future, but they're 
            worth bringing up now.

        <b>This is bolded text outside of a paragraph.</b>
        <i>This is italicized text outside of a paragraph</i>
