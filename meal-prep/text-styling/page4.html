        <!--
            Notice how there is margin (space) between our paragraph 
            elements, similar to the heading (h1-h6) elements.  Most
            other HTML elements don't behave this way, as we'll see
            in a moment.

            Next, we're going to use the bold and italics elements
            (<b> for bold and <i> for italics).

            In the future, the students will learn better ways to style 
            text in CSS, but for the moment, using styling elements like 
            these is enough.

            First we'll illustrate how they behave outside of a paragraph.
        -->
        <b>This is bolded text outside of a paragraph.</b>
        <i>This is italicized text outside of a paragraph</i>
        <!--
            Notice how the elements end up right next to each other.  
            That is because the bold and italics elements (and most of 
            the other styling elements) are considered "inline" 
            elements, while the paragraph is a "block" element.

            We'll learn more about those terms in the future, but 
            they're worth bringing up now.
