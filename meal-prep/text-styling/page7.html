            Finally, we'll add a couple more unusual HTML elements:
            the line break element (<br>) and horizontal rule element (<hr>).

            These elements don't accept any children, and actually
            break the convention we told you before about each HTML
            element requiring an opening and closing tag: these only
            require a single opening tag.

            The line break element and horizontal rule elements
            modify the formatting of the page, rather than
            modifying any children.
        -->
        <p>
            This sentence has a line break
            <br> 
            in the middle of it.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            This paragraph is separated from the one above it by a 
            horizontal rule.
        </p>
        <!--
            The line break and horizontal rule elements are special
            HTML elements called "Void Elements".
            
            Unlike "normal" HTML elements, void elements don't have 
            closing tags, because they can't accept children.

            What would it mean to put content inside of a line break?
            Or a horizontal rule? That simply doesn't make sense.

            So, they're called "void" elements, since nothing can 
            go inside of them, neither text nor other HTML elements.
