            To remedy this "dirty code", we're going to split the 
            paragraph element across multiple lines, so that all
            of our code is visible at once.

            Note that this does not affect the page preview at all, but
            it does make the code much easier to read.  This is referred
            to as increasing the "human readability" factor of our code,
            which is very important when it comes to writing "clean
            code".

            Also note how we indented the text inside relative to the 
            opening and closing paragraph tags. This is VERY important 
            for writing "clean code": 
            
            Anything that is inside opening/closing tags and is split 
            across multiple lines should be indented one level 
            to the right.

            Brief aside: anything in between the opening and closing tags 
            of an element are referred to as "children" of the element 
            whose tags they are in between)

            Splitting long code across multiple lines and indenting
            children of an element are two best practices we really
            want to hammer into the students.
