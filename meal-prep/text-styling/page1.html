            We'll start off with a basic paragraph (<p>) element.
            
            HTML elements often use tag names that are frustratingly
            short compared to their actual names ('p' compared to 
            'paragraph'); that's one thing you'll just have
            to get used to.
        -->
        <p>This is my first paragraph</p>
