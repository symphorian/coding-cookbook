        <p>This is my first paragraph</p>
        <!--
            Now we'll add another paragraph element, 
            but this time we're going to use the lorem
            ipsum 'Emmet Abbreviation'.

            Just start typing 'lorem' inside your paragraph,
            and you'll see the dropdown option.

            Select that, and you should see something like
            the text below.
        -->
        <p>Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Magni maxime alias tenetur officia, ipsa rerum asperiores libero doloribus optio quod minus tempore, consectetur corporis est deleniti! Accusantium molestiae perferendis aperiam.</p>
    
        <!--
            However, this illustrates an example of "dirty code".

            The text goes way off the edge of the screen (in the
            code editor), and we can't even see that there's a 
            closing </p> tag at the end. We'll address that in 
            the next page.
        -->
