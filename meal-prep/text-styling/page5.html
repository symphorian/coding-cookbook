        <b>This is bolded text outside of a paragraph.</b>
        <i>This is italicized text outside of a paragraph</i>
        <!--
            Now we'll add bold and italicized text elements
            inside of paragraph elements.

            It's technically not necessary to give the <b> and <i>
            elements their own lines, but it does make it much 
            clearer where the styled text begins and ends, so we
            encourage you to do the same!

        <p>
            This is 
            <b>bolded text</b> 
            inside of a paragraph.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is 
            <i>italicized text</i> 
            inside of a paragraph.
        </p>
        <!--
            Notice how the bold and italized elements in the preview
            are in-line with the text? Again, that is because they 
            are "inline" HTML elements.
