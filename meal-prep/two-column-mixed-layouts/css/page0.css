/*
    The goal of this demo is to show how we use
    both CSS Grid and Flexbox together in a page layout.

    As we said at the beginning of each of the powerpoints,
    our "Page Layouts" are not necessarily the only layout
    on the page, and we're going to combine a couple 
    different layouts in this demo.

    We're also going to use a layout that's a bit of a
    sneak peek into our 3rd Layout Week, where we
    cover Navigation.

    Encourage the students to really pay attention for
    this one, as it will be a good starting point for
    their "MeTube" project due later today, which is
    going to be their own personal take on YouTube.

    We'll start out as always with our HTML layout first,
    using three containers inside of the grid-layout
    element: a header, a sidebar, and a main element.
