                You will likely need a full 5 minutes for this drill.

                It's not that complicated of a solution, basically
                just wrapping content in headings and <sub> or <sup>
                elements, but the code can get messy rather quickly,
                which may trip you up.
                
                I've reformatted the solution here to keep it clean
                by splitting some of the content across multiple lines.
                You don't necessarily have to have yours exactly the
                same, but consider whether your code is easier or
                harder to read compared to the solution here.

                Also, while it often makes the code easier to read
                by putting styling elements on their own lines, there's
                also a side effect of doing so: spaces get added around 
                them on the page.

                For bold and italic elements, that's not usually a 
                problem, but for superscript and subscript elements
                which are usually supposed to follow immediately after
                their associated letter, that won't look good.

                So, in some cases, we HAVE to keep the styling elements
                on the same line as the content around them, in order
                for us to avoid extra spaces on the page.
