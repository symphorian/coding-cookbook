                This one shouldn't be too bad, as long as you remember
                the Line Break elements. Other than that, it's just 
                the usual headings and paragraphs.

                The Line Break elements don't technically need to be
                on their own lines, but doesn't it look cleaner and
                more organized that way?

                    It can be very beneficial to take a few times a 
                    day to just
                    <br>
                    stop
                    <br>
                    breathe
                    <br>
                    and simply sit in the moment.
