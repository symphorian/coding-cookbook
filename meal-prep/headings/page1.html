            Then, add your first html element: an h1 heading.

            Recall what you (should have) just learned about 
            tags and elements:

            The most basic tag structure is composed of 3 parts:
            - a left triangle bracket (<)
            - a tag name
            - a right triangle bracket (>)

            An element is (usually) composed of 3 parts as well
            - an opening tag
            - content (could be text, or HTML element(s))
            - a closing tag

            Observe these parts in the element we add below. 
        -->
        <h1>This is an example of heading level 1.</h1>
    </body>
