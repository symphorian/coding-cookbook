            Repeat for headings h3 - h6.
            Call out that there are no heading levels after 6.
            Yes, it's fairly arbitrary, but that's how it is.

        <h3>This is an example of heading level 3.</h3>
        <h4>This is an example of heading level 4.</h4>
        <h5>This is an example of heading level 5.</h5>
        <h6>This is an example of heading level 6.</h6>
        <!--
            After completing h6, call out the differences between
            the heading levels (again, basically just font-size),
            but also note how there is margin (space) in between
            each heading. That's something you get for free by
            using headings, but not necessarily with other 
            HTML elements.
