        <!--
            After creating the new CSS file, we need to 
            link it to this HTML file; to do so, we 
            use a new element called a link <link>
            (distinct from the anchor <a> element, 
            which is often referred to as a link.)

            The <link> element is one of those special 
            "Void Elements" that should not have a 
            closing tag.

            There are two attributes we MUST include
            in the link element: href and rel

            The href attribute should be somewhat familiar
            at this point, since we used it in anchor 
            elements (aka hyperlinks); similar to how we
            used it with anchors, we provide a file path
            that points to where the file that we want to 
            load is at.

            In this case, we specify "css/style.css",
            telling the document to look in the
            "css" folder for the file called "style.css".

            The rel attribute (short for relationship)
            defines the relationship between the linked
            resource and the current document.  In this
            case, we want to provide the value "stylesheet",
            since the file we're linking to is a
            CSS stylesheet.

            You MUST include the rel attribute with the
            value "stylesheet", or else your CSS will
            not be applied to your HTML document.

        <link href="css/page1.css" rel="stylesheet" data-meal-prep>
        <!--
            (Ignore the file name in these demo files,
            just use style.css in your demo for the students.
            These demos use separate files to
            break up the different parts of the demos for you,
            so we need different file names for each.)

            (Also ignore the 'data-meal-prep' attribute when
            going through this demo; this is just a
            custom attribute to configure how the code
            loads in the Cookbook demo site)
