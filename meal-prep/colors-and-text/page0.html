            We're going to start off relatively slow
            in CSS, just showing students how to 
            modify the color and other properties of 
            text using CSS.

            Start off by duplicating your code-skeleton
            as usual, and renaming it something like
            colors-and-text.

            First, we're going to put a basic paragraph
            element with some lorem ipsum on the page.
