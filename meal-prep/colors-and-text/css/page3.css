#first-paragraph {

/*
    Let's add another CSS Rule and another
    paragraph, so that we can try to change
    its color as well.

    This time, let's target the id
    'second-paragraph', set its color property
    this time with the hexidecimal color
    value for red: #FF0000

    This is to show we're not limited to HTML
    color names (which are fairly limited in
    the first place).

    Students can pick whatever color they want,
    it doesn't have to be red.  In fact, you can
    even ask them for the colors to use in
    the demo.
*/

#second-paragraph {
    color: #FF0000;
}

/*
    remind students (over and over again)
    that ID Selectors must start with the #,
    followed by the value of the id attribute
    we want to target.

    It's also worth reminding students that when
    setting CSS property values, they must
    include 
        - the property name
        - the assignment operator (:) 
        - the property value
        - the assignment terminator (;)

    Make sure to add the paragraph element with 
    the 'second-paragraph' id attribute value in
    the HTML, if you haven't already.
