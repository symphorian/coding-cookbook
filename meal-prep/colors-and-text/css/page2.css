    Now that we successfully have our CSS and HTML
    connected (or at least, we hopefully do),
    let's test out the connection with our first
    CSS Rule!

    You should have already covered the CSS
    PowerPoint, going over the different 
    parts of a CSS rule, so now students
    actually get to see them implemented.

    Since CSS is always interconnected with HTML,
    you need pieces set up in both files for
    any visual change to occur.

    These demos show the CSS code first, but
    you can technically write the code in any
    order you choose: HTML first, and then the
    CSS rules, or the CSS rules first and then
    the HTML.

    My preference is to write the HTML part
    first, and then write the CSS rule that
    targets the HTML, but it's up to you how
    you'd like to demo.

    Now, back to the CSS Rules: for today's
    demo, we're only going to use ID Selectors,
    since they tend to be the simplest to 
    understand.  We'll use the other selectors
    in other demos throughout the week.

    We're going to write an ID Selector to 
    target the paragraph element on the page.
    We'll use the id value 'first-paragraph', 
    and set the color property with the value 
    blue in our new CSS Rule.
*/

#first-paragraph {
    color: blue;
}

/*
    Assuming there is an id on the paragraph 
    called "first-paragraph", we should see
    that particular paragraph turn blue.

    ...although, if you wrote the CSS first,
    then nothing will happen, because you
    need to go back to the HTML and add that
    id attribute!
