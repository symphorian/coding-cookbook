    NOTE: Chances are, you've already linked 
    your CSS and HTML in the code-skeleton 
    folder, assuming you followed the updated
    Web Dev Setup tutorial.

    If so, you can skip the instructions on
    this page, since you've already done this
    step.

    However, we will still leave this page here,
    in case some students do NOT have them 
    connected, and because it still has useful
    information about the different approaches
    that can be used to include CSS on a web
    page.

    Next we're going to write some CSS...
    or at least, we'd like to, but first
    we need to create a separate file
    (called a stylesheet) to hold our
    CSS code.

    This approach is referred to as using
    "External CSS"; other approaches include
    "Internal CSS" and "Inline CSS", which
    have their place in web development, but
    the most commonly used approach is 
    definitely External CSS, so it is the
    approach we're teaching in this course.

    In the /css folder of your duplicated
    code skeleton project folder, 
    create a new file called 'style.css'; 
    the name can really be whatever you want, 
    as long as it matches the code we're 
    about to write next in the HTML.
