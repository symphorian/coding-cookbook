/*
    This is a relatively "short and sweet" set
    of drills, focused on creating single
    column layouts.

    Doing so really just requires setting
    an explicit width on a container, and
    then applying the 'auto' value to one
    or both of its margin sides.

    Pretty straightforward, but still may 
    trip you up without practice,
    which is why we're doing these drills.
