/* Drill 2 - Write your code solution below */

/*
    The first half of this solution is the same
    as the previous drill.

    The second half is the somewhat tricky part
    if you don't know what you're doing.

    The 'auto' value can only be applied to
    left and right margins of block elements
    (if you expect it to do anything, at least).

    Applying it to one side will shove all the
    remaining space into the margin side you 
    specified.

    In this case, we apply it to margin-left,
    which forces the element all the way to
    the right.

    That might seem a little backwards (setting
    margin-left in order to move the element
    to the right), but remember, we're applying
    the 'auto' value to the margin property,
    which has to do with spacing, not position.

#column-d2 {
    width: 50%;
    margin-left: auto;
}
