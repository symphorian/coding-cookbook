/*
    A left aligned single column is the easiest,
    since you don't need to even change anything
    related to its position, since block elements
    are left aligned by default.

    The only thing we need to do here is set
    the container width.

    Students can choose to use absolute or relative
    units for the width (either around 300px or 50%).

#column-d1 {
    width: 50%;
