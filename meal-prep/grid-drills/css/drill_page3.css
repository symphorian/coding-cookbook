/* Drill 3 - Write your code solution below */

/*
    This drill is a set up for the next one.

    Students can technically solve this one
    by just activating the grid and setting
    up the three columns.

    Setting up grid-template-areas properly
    will look exactly the same if they do
    it correctly.

    However, encourage them to try to use
    the grid-template-areas property for 
    practice (again, in preparation for 
    the next drill).
