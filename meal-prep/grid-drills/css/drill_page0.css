/*
    This is a drill set that focuses on
    CSS Grid.

    There's even less properties to remember
    for Grid compared to Flexbox; however,
    they are a bit...different, compared to
    Flexbox and even normal CSS Properties.

    However, the importance of identifying
    Containers and Items has not changed,
    and that is also where you will likely
    mess up the most!

    The main properties you will need 
    to know how to use are:

    - Grid Container Properties
        - display: grid;
        - grid-template-columns
        - grid-template-areas
    - Grid Item Properties
        - grid-area

    Feel free to review these before beginning.
