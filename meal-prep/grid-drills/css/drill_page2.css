/* Drill 2 - Write your code solution below */

/*
    This drill is similar to the previous one,
    but this time we have three columns, and the
    middle one is roughly twice as large as
    the outer ones.

    Again, students CAN use absolute or 
    relative units, but it's a lot more work
    to do the math or trial-and-error to figure
    out the exact values, as opposed to just
    using fractional units.
