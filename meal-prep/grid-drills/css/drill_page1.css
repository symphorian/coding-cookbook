/* Drill 1 - Write your code solution below */

/*
    This drill focuses on the basics:
    activating the grid functionality, and
    then setting up two columns.

    You could also have used absolute
    or relative units to solve this one
    (something like 235px or 47%), but
    fractional units make things MUCH 
    easier and more flexible if you just
    want equally sized columns that fill
    the available space.

    Remember, columns with fractional units 
    divide the remaining available space
    between themselves and other columns
    that also use fractional units, so 
    they're ideal for layouts that want
    to utilize all available space.
