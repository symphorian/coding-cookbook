    Today's demo is all about Media Queries.

    Remember that Media Queries allow us to 
    alter page styles when specific conditions
    are met; most frequently, these conditions
    have to do with the page width.

    So we're going to start off with a very
    basic example of how media queries can
    change a page.

    We begin by constructing the media query
    itself.

    Remember the three main parts of a media
    query:
    - the at-rule (@media)
    - the Media Type (screen or print)
    - the Media Features (e.g. max-width)

    We'll create a media query that targets
    the page when the screen width is 
    480px or less.
*/

@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
    /*
        Now that we've constructed our media
        query, inside of it, we can start
        creating CSS rules.

        We'll start with a very basic one that
        changes the page background.

        You'll probably be tempted to immediately
        start writing "background-color...",
        but Media Queries are almost like their
        own mini CSS files: you need to write
        complete CSS Rules inside, even though
        we're inside a set of curly braces.
    */
    body {
        background-color: firebrick;
    }
}

/*
    Now, when you shrink the preview window down
    below 480px in width, the background color 
    should turn red; neat, right?
