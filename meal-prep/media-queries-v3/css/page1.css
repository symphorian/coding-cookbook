/* 
    Our first Media Query is actually a 
    pretty good one for targeting mobile
    devices; it may not cover ALL possible
    phone screens, but it should cover most.

    For that reason, sometimes Media Queries
    are referred to as "breakpoints"; for
    our Media Query below, we might refer to
    it as our "mobile breakpoint", because
    as soon as we sink below 480px in width,
    we "break" into the mobile design.

    ("Media Queries" are more of a technical 
    term, while "breakpoints" are more of a 
    design term.)

    However, it's not uncommon to have more than 
    one breakpoint; most websites will definitely
    have a mobile breakpoint, but some will also
    have a tablet breakpoint.

    So let's create another Media Query to target
    somewhere between a mobile width and what
    we consider a desktop width.

    I'm going to put this new Media Query ABOVE
    my mobile breakpoint, because most of the 
    time we'll organize our CSS code like this:

    Desktop CSS
    Tablet CSS
    Mobile CSS

    (it's just a nice, logical way to organize
    our code, with some safety benefits we'll 
    address later)

    And this time, we're going to be combining
    two media features in our new tablet breakpoint.

    (Tablet devices are also very diverse in their
    screen resolution, but 768px is not a common
    boundary to use as a tablet breakpoint)
*/

@media screen and (max-width: 768px) and (min-width: 481px) {
    /*
        We'll target the body again, but this
        time give it a different color, to
        differentiate between when we're hitting
        different breakpoints.
    */
    body {
        background-color: skyblue;
    }
}

/*
    And with that, now you can see very clearly
    that we actually have 3 different breakpoints
    set up: 
    - on desktop, the background is white
    - on tablet, the backgroud is blue
    - on mobile, the background is red

    Now, in reality, you probably won't be changing 
    background colors like this on an actual site.

    However, this is a great debugging strategy.
    If your Media Query code doesn't seem to be
    working, and you're not sure whether you're
    in a breakpoint or not, changing the background
    color is a big, obvious way to signal when
    you've moved into another design breakpoint.

        background-color: firebrick;
    }
