/*
    This is a demo primarily about hiding and showing
    content, using :hover and CSS Transitions.

    This is actually getting them ready for tomorrow,
    when we'll be building dropdown menus, but
    students tend to freak out about the
    hiding/showing part of dropdown menus,
    so hopefully this will be preparing for that.

    We'll be exploring different approaches to 
    hiding/showing content using cards, to keep
    things more consistent across implementations.

    So, first things first, we'll build out our
    cards in the HTML.
