/*
    This is a demo primarily about hiding and showing
    content, using :hover and CSS Transitions.

    This is actually a stepping stone for building
    dropdown menus; the hiding/showing of a dropdown
    menu tends to be the most challenging part, so
    we're demoing that apart from the menus 
    themselves today to separate the concepts a bit.

    We'll be exploring different approaches to 
    hiding/showing content using cards, to keep
    things more consistent across implementations.

    So, first things first, we'll build out our
    cards in the HTML.
