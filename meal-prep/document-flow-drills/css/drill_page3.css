/* Drill 3 - Write your code solution below */

/*
    The goal of this drill is to get the block
    elements side-by-side; the hint for this 
    drill directly tells them which display
    value to use, so it should be easy for them.

    However, I recommend showing them what happens
    if you use the value inline instead of
    inline-block; then they'll see the peculiar
    behavior of inline elements, where they 
    ignore the vertical spacing given to them
    and act as they were purely text with no
    styling or decoration on them.
