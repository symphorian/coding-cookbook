/* Drill 2 - Write your code solution below */

/*
    This drill is the opposite of Drill 1:
    we're converting the display of span elements
    from their default inline behavior into
    block elements.

    Span elements are typically only used to contain
    text or other inline elements, which is why their
    styling in this drill is "flatter" compared to the
    block elements in the previous drill.
