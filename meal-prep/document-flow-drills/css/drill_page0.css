/*
    This is another drill set, focusing this time 
    on Document Flow, one of the most
    fundamental aspects of HTML and CSS.

    Understanding how the elements in your 
    HTML document flow by default on the page, 
    and how to alter that flow, is critical to 
    implementing any kind of web design layout.

    It's actually relatively straightforward:
    
    block elements take up a whole line and 
    don't sit side-by-side,

    inline elements take up as much space as
    they need and can sit side-by-side
    (but have some vertical spacing limitations),

    and finally, inline-block elements are like
    inline elements, but without the vertical
    spacing limitations.

    These concepts are fairly easy to understand
    independently, but student seem to struggle
    once they need to put them into practice.
