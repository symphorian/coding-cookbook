/* Drill 4 - Write your code solution below */

/*
    Same solution as Drill 5, just showcasing 
    a different scenario, where each block is
    given an explicit width value.

    When inline-blocks have an explicit width,
    they respect that width, and are allowed 
    to sit side-by-side with other elements 
    on the same line if they an fit.

    However, again, it's beneficial to show
    students the difference between inline
    and inline-block here: inline elements 
    will NOT respect the widths given them.

    They'll only take up as much space as 
    they need, and will show that weird
    overlapping behavior again, since they
    don't respect the vertical spacing
    given to them.

    So, most of the time, if we want elements
    with any sort of styling on them to sit
    side-by-side, we'll usually use the
    inline-block display value instead of
    inline.
