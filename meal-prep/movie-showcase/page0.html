            This is only a partially completed example of
            what could be the "movie showcase" option for
            the Week 1 project, since the completed project
            would basically just be "rinse and repeat" with 
            different content for each movie.

            Remember, <img> elements are inline elements,
            so unless you put a block element or line break
            between them, they'll line up side-by-side, as below.

            Maintaining a consistent height between them all
            will create a very clean looking layout (assuming
            all the images have mostly the same aspect ratio)

            For each individual image showcase, we take advantage
            of inline elements like <b> and <i> to
            keep content on the same line.

            To add extra horizontal space between elements in the
            same line, we can be a little hacky (since we haven't
            learned CSS yet) and use the HTML entity for a 
            space (&nbsp;) to add some extra horizontal margin.

            Then to separate content vertically, we use block 
            elements (like <p>) or line break elements (<br>) .

            Below are examples of how to load up icons
            from the Font Awesome icon library.
            
            Again, remember that you can only use "free"
            icons in this way; "pro" icons (or icon 
            styles) will not load at all.

            And yes, they are choosing to use the <i>
            element as if "i" stood for "icon" instead
            of "italics".  Not the best practice, but
            a very common one across the internet.

            As long as no one puts any content inside 
            of the element, it shouldn't really hurt
            anything, despite not being used as intended.

        <h4>SYNOPSIS</h4>
        <p>
            Sophie (Emily Mortimer) has an uneventful life at 
            her late father's hat shop, but all that<br>changes 
            when she runs into the wizard Howl (Christian 
            Bale), who lives in a magical flying<br>castle. 
            The possessive Witch of Waste (Lauren Bacall) 
            takes issue with their encounter and casts<br>a spell 
            on young Sophie, which ages her prematurely. Now
            an elderly grandma, Sophie must<br>either learn to 
            accept to her new form, or find the courage and
            confidence to break her curse.
