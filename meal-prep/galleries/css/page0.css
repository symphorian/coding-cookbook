/*
    This demo is going to cover a few different
    ways to create Gallery content layouts using
    the CSS Layout Modules we've learned (and
    also one we haven't).

    We'll start off with using CSS Grid.
    CSS Grid can make a pretty nice looking 
    gallery... as long as all the images are 
    the exact same aspect ratio / dimensions.

    We'll start off using the provided images,
    to make sure everyone is working with the
    same assets.

    First, setup the HTML with a gallery of
    landscape images.
