/*
    The only real downside to using the 
    columns property to set up a vertical
    masonry gallery is that it's a little
    more complex to add spacing between
    images.

    We basically need to do it in two steps: 
    one at the container level, and one at 
    the item level.

    On the container level, we need to add
    another property called column-gap
    (similar to the gap property, but only
    usable with the columns property)
*/

.vertical-masonry-gallery {
    columns: 3 auto;
    column-gap: 24px; /* new */
}

/*
    The column-gap property does what you
    can probably guess: adds space between
    columns.

    But what about the vertical space between
    images? That we need to address by adding
    margin to each individual item (or image,
    in this case)
*/

.vertical-masonry-gallery img {
    width: 100%;
    margin-bottom: 24px;
}

/*
    So, not too difficult to adjust the spacing,
    but a bit more compared to just using the
    gap property with flexboxes and grids.

    The other downside (which is true of vertical
    masonry layouts as a whole) is that you'll
    have a jagged edge of images at the bottom
    of the gallery.

    The columns property actually does a decent
    job of balancing the heights of the columns,
    but there's only so much it can do when you
    have radically different images sizes.

    So keep that in mind if you're considering
    using vertical masonry layouts.

    That's it for our Galleries demo!  Now you
    have a few more Content Layouts in your 
    tool kit that you can use going forward!
