    Grids are great for galleries when the
    images inside them are all the same size.

    However, when images are different sizes
    or aspect ratios, then things start getting
    a bit ugly looking.

    We're going to add a new gallery in the HTML,
    and give it the class "cropped-grid-gallery",
    in anticipation of our next type of gallery.

    This gallery is going to have a bunch of 
    images with different aspect ratios.

    (add HTML)

    Then we're going to add similar grid CSS as
    above, and see how it affects the gallery.
