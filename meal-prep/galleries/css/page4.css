    We need a way to adjust the heights of
    the images in the grid, to get rid of that
    ugly white space inside.

    To do that, we can add heights to the grid
    rows, much like we did with the widths in
    our columns.

    However, the rows in a grid behave differently
    from the columns: we explicitly defined the 
    number of columns, but we never did that with
    the rows; they just keep getting added 
    automatically.

    Because of that, we're not going to be defining
    a template for the grid rows; instead, we're
    going to be adjusting the AUTOmatic row
    behavior, telling it to set a height for all
    new rows that it creates, using a new 
    property called grid-auto-rows.

    The gaps between images are gone...but
    now many of our images are all squished.

    We can address that by adding another 
    property that you may have encountered 
    before: object-fit

    This property, when given the 'cover' 
    value will cause images to crop rather
    than stretch/squish the image when 
    their CSS dimensions don't match the
    image aspect ratio.
