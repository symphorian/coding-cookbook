            There is one more attribute we should mention that is 
            related to images: the alternate (alt) attribute.

            The alt attribute basically lets us specify a textual
            description of the image, and in the scenario that
            our image doesn't load, the alt attribute value will
            be displayed instead.

            The alt attribute contributes to our page's "web 
            accessibility", which refers to how accessible our 
            page is to other avenues of viewing a web page.

            Blind people use the internet too, you know, usually
            via technology like "screen readers", which literally
            ready out the code and page content on a web page.

            A screen reader can't "read" an image, but it can
            read out the alt attribute value.

            You can check out that the alt attribute works
            by deleting a random character from your src
            attribute.

            You should see a broken link icon, with your 
            alt text showing up after it. 
            
            After confirming this, undo the code change 
            you made to your src attribute with Cmd+Z
            (or Ctrl+Z for PC users).
