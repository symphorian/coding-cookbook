            One last thing to experiment with: you can set
            a 'height' attribute instead of (or in addition to)
            the 'width' attribute.

            Try replacing the width attribute on your first
            image with a height attribute, and then try
            adding a height attribute to your second image.
        -->
        <img 
            src="images/egypt-kitty.webp" 
            height="300" 
            alt="a fancy exotic cat wearing an egyptian outfit"
        >
        <img 
            src="images/anxious-kitty.webp"
            width="200"
            height="300"
            alt="an adorable, yet concerned looking cat"
        >
        <!--
            As you can see, setting just the height attribute
            resizes the image proportionately, just like 
            using the width attribute.

            But when we use BOTH the height and width attribute,
            the image gets distorted, squishing or stretching
            to fit the dimensions we specified.

            For this reason, we usually don't recommend using 
            both width AND height together; later on we'll learn
            an approach to change the image element's behavior
            to crop instead of distort the image, but that's 
            a few weeks down the line.

            That wraps up this demo!

            Rememeber what you learned about HTML Attributes:

            - attributes only live inside the opening tag of
            an HTML element

            - HTML attributes are composed of three main parts:
                - the attribute name
                - the assignment operator (=)
                - the attribute value (wrapped in double quotes "")

            - you can have multiple attributes in the same element

            - if multiple attributes don't fit on one line,
            you can break the tag and attributes onto separate lines
            with the attributes indented, similar to how we should
            indent children within their parents
