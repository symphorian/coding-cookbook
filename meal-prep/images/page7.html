            Notice how the images sit side by side?

            That's because images are categorized as a
            type of element called "inline" elements.

            As their name implies, "inline" element will
            sit in-line, or side by side, with other "inline"
            elements, as long as there is enough space.

            If there isn't enough space, they'll wrap to the
            next line, and that's what happens if we increase
            the width of the images so that they no longer
            fit together.

            (Try this out too)

            "inline" elements are part of a broader concept
            in web dev known as "Document Flow"; we'll learn 
            more about this concept next week.
