            That should get our image loaded, but we still may 
            struggle with the size issue. If so, we can adjust
            it with the width attribute again; OR, we could also
            use the height attribute for similar effect.

            However, I don't recommend using both width and
            height together; that could modify the image's
            aspect ratio, causing it to squash or stretch.

            Also, don't forget to add the alt attribute as well.
