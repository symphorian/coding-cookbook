            The image attribute responsible for pulling an image
            onto our page is the source (src) attribute.

            Remember that HTML attributes are composed of three
            main parts:
                - the attribute name
                - the assignment operator (=)
                - the attribute value (wrapped in double quotes "")

            Go to Google and search for cat pics, or whatever else
            you'd enjoy putting onto your page.
            
            Assuming you've created this demo example in a duplicated
            copy-skeleton template, you should have an 'images' folder
            right next to where this code is. (If not, create one now)

            Save that image you found in your 'images' folder 
            (I recommend renaming the image to something short and 
            easy to type). 
            
            Or, if you just downloaded it to your 'Downloads' folder, 
            click and drag it into your 'images' folder from there.

            Make sure you put it in the correct folder!

            Because in the next step, we're going to tell our 
            new image element how to find the image we want to 
            pull onto the page, and if you didn't put it in the
            'images' folder in your demo folder, the code won't
            be able to find it!
        -->

        <!--
            The src attribute value is essentially the directions 
            we're  giving to the image element, so it knows how to 
            find the image we want it to load.

            For this image, we're going to tell it how to access 
            the image we downloaded into our repository by giving it 
            what's called a "local path"; think of it like telling 
            a friend how to get from "here" to your house.

            Where you currently are is in index.html (hopefully), 
            and your image is in the adjacent 'images' folder with 
            a specific file name.

            So, we'll start by telling the computer to look for 
            the "images" folder.  
            
            Then we tell it to look inside it with a slash "/".
            
            Finally, we tell it the file name of the image; in 
            this case, that would be "egypt-kitty.webp".

            So our completed local path looks like 
            "images/egypt-kitty.webp"
            
            (or whatever your file name is instead of 
            "egypt-kitty.webp")
        -->
        <img src="images/egypt-kitty.webp">

        <!--
            Now you should have an image loaded up on the page!

            ...but there's probably a small problem (or big problem
            depending on how you look at it).

            Continue to the next page to figure out how to fix it!
