            The image attribute responsible for pulling an image
            onto our page is the source (src) attribute.

            Remember that HTML attributes are composed of three
            main parts:
                - the attribute name
                - the assignment operator (=)
                - the attribute value (wrapped in double quotes "")

            There are two different ways we can use this attribute.
            The first way is easier, but also dirtier and more fragile,
            while the second requires a bit more effect, but is 
            cleaner and more stable.

            The first way, which we're going to use now, is pulling
            an image from somewhere else on the internet onto 
            our page.

            Go to Google and search for images of a cat or something;
            encourage the students to google something they enjoy.
            
            Once you find something you like, right click on the 
            image and select the "Copy image address" option
            (NOT "Copy image" or "Copy link address").

            Then paste that copied image address directly into 
            the src attribute value's double quotes.

            That should get an image loaded into your page, but
            there are likely a couple problems...

            First, the src attribute value is probably 
            overflowing over the edge of the screen of your
            code editor, which is really dirty code.

            Unfortunately though, we can't break the image URL
            across multiple lines, as that would break the element.
            So we're kinda just stuck with it.

            Continue to the next page to see what the second
            one issue, and how we can address it.
