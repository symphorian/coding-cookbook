            First, update the title from 'Document' to whatever
            is appropriate for the page (in this case, 'Images Demo').

            It's very easy to forget to update this,
            so I encourage students to make this the first thing
            they do whenever they work in a new HTML file.
            
            It has no visual difference on the page itself, but it will
            change what shows up in the browser tab for the page.
