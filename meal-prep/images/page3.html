            Depending on the resolution of the image you chose, 
            you might have an ENORMOUS image on your page. As in, 
            so large that it overflows off the edge of the page.

            We can address that by adding a width attribute to 
            the image, which accepts a number that it interprets
            in pixels. (Note that this is a temporary fix;
            once we learn CSS, that will be the preferred
            way to set the image width and height.)

            Try out different width values and see which
            you like best.
