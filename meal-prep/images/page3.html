            The second issue, depending on the resolution of the 
            image you chose, is you might have an ENORMOUS image 
            on your page. As in, so large that it overflows off 
            the edge of the page.

            We can address that by adding a width attribute to 
            the image, which accepts a number that it interprets
            in pixels. (Note that this is a temporary fix;
            once we learn CSS, that will be the preferred
            way to set the image width and height.)

            But if we add a width attribute to the same line,
            it's going to be way off the edge of the code
            editor window, which is also pretty dirty code,
            since anyone else reading the code wouldn't
            know we added that to the end.

            We can't fix the image src dirty code issue, but 
            thankfully we can address this issue by splitting 
            the image tag and attributes across multiple lines.

            We do this in a similar way as we split up 
            elements across multiple lines, as seen below.
            (Feel free to pick whatever width value works for you.)
        -->
        <img 
            src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26392d05302e02f7bf4eb143bb84c8097d09144b/446_167_3683_2210/master/3683.jpg?width=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a52bbe202f57ac0f5ff7f47166906403"
            width="500"
        >
        <!--
            Notice how each attribute has its own line now,
            in addition the combination of the opening
            triangle bracket and element name (<img)
            and the closing triangle bracket (>).

            Also notice how the attributes are indented one
            level to the right of the beginning and ending
            parts of the opening tag.

            That keeps our code nice and clean, while
            also being clear that each attribute with its
            own line "belongs" to the tag it's inside of,
            thanks to the indentation.

            And of course, now that we've added the width
            attribute, our image is resized to a much more
            manageable size.
