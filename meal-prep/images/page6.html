            Just for practice, let's add another image to our page.

            Do another quick Google search for another image of 
            your choice, and add it to this page.

            Don't forget to add the width and alt attributes
            (and to write them cleanly on separate lines)!

            Now that we have two images, let's explore a bit
            how images naturally behave on a page.
