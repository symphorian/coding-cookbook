            Next up, google another image you want to add to your page,
            but this time, instead of right-clicking and selecting 
            "Copy image address", we're going to select "Save image as...".

            Assuming you've created this demo example in a duplicated
            copy-skeleton template, you should have an 'images' folder
            right next to where this code is. (If not, create one now)

            Save that image you found in your images folder (I recommend
            renaming the image to something short and easy to type). 
            Or, if you just downloaded it to your 'Downloads' folder, 
            click and drag it into your images folder from there.

            Make sure you put it in the correct folder!

            Because in the next step, we're going to tell our new image
            element how to find the image we want to pull onto the page.
        -->
        <br>
        <img src="images/egypt-kitty.webp">
        <!--
            The src attribute value is essentially the directions we're
            telling to the image element, so it knows how to find the
            image we want it to load.

            For our first image, we gave it a web URL address (which is not
            actually that different from a street address in real life).

            For this image, we're going to tell it how to access the image
            we downloaded into our repository. But for local images, you
            need to give it a "local path"; think of it like telling a 
            friend how to get from "here" to your house.

            Where you currently are is in index.html (hopefully), and your
            image is in the adjacent 'images' folder with a specific file
            name.

            So, we'll start by telling the computer to look for the "images"
            folder.  Then we tell it to look inside it with a slash "/".
            Finally, we tell it the file name of the image; in this case,
            that's "egypt-kitty.webp".
