            But if we add an alt attribute to the same line,
            our code could start to go off the edge of the code
            editor window; this is dirty code, because whoever
            is reading it may not be able to see the entire
            line without scrolling.

            (Remember, dirty code is not the same thing as
            broken code; dirty code has to do with what we
            might call "human readability". Clean code is 
            easy to read, dirty code is hard to read.)

            We can address this issue by splitting 
            the image tag and attributes across multiple lines.

            We do this in a similar way as we split up 
            elements across multiple lines, as seen below.
        -->
        <img 
            src="images/egypt-kitty.webp" 
            width="500" 
            alt="a fancy exotic cat wearing an egyptian outfit"
        >
        <!--
            Notice how each attribute has its own line now,
            in addition to the combination of the opening
            triangle bracket and tag name (<img)
            and the closing triangle bracket (>).

            Also notice how the attributes are indented one
            level to the right of the beginning and ending
            parts of the opening tag (similar to how we
            indent child elements inside of a parent)

            That keeps our code nice and clean, while
            also being clear that each attribute with its
            own line "belongs" to the tag it's inside of,
            thanks to the indentation.
