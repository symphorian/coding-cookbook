            Alright, so that's it for our "dirty and fragile" way
            of adding an image to our page.  The dirtiness aspect
            we've already discussed.

            But why is it fragile? 

            Well, because your link to that image can break at any
            time.  You don't have any control over that image, 
            some other site does.  If they decide to take it down
            or replace it with another, you will no longer have 
            the image you want up on your site.

            So, let's show how to add an image to your site via a
            method that will require a little extra effort, but
            will also be a lot cleaner and more stable.

            Let's start by adding a line break (because images
            are also inline elements, so if we don't want them
            side-by-side we need to force them to another line),
            along with another image element to our page.
