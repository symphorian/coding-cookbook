            Image HTML elements are some of the most engaging
            elements you can add to a web page; as the old 
            saying goes, "a picture says a thousand words",
            and images can certainly do a lot to change
            the mood or vibe of your website.

            So let's get started by adding an image element
            to our page.

            Note that the image element is another of the
            "void" elements, that doesn't have a closing 
            tag, nor does it accept children.

        <img>
        <!--
            ...as you can see, nothing really happened.

            We do have an image element on our page, we
            haven't told it what image to load, so it
            doesn't actually do anything.

            To make that happen, we're going to have 
            use what we learned about HTML Attributes
            (or if we haven't learned it yet, let's 
            take a brief detour and go over them).
