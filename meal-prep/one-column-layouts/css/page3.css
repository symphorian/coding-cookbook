    Student often only look at the preview panel inside of
    Visual Studio Code when testing, but that panel is 
    usually much narrower than an actual browser window.

    So starting today, encourage students to start previewing
    their code using the "Open with Live Server" option
    instead of "Show Preview".

    "Open with Live Server" will open up their HTML in
    a web browser, which will allow them to preview it
    in a more natural setting, and they can also use
    the Chrome Developer Tools to inspect it as well.

    This will require a bit of window switching, so it
    may feel a little annoying or inconvenient,
    especially for students with only one monitor,
    but the pros outweigh the cons when it comes to
    previewing and testing their code.

    This is a also a good time to remind them that we 
    expect them to use Google Chrome for development in
    this course; if the "Open with Live Server" option
    opens their code in Safari, they can still copy the
    URL from the browser to open it up in Chrome instead.

    Anyway, with the code we have now, we have a basic
    single column layout, aligned to the left.

    Left alignment is the default, so we don't need to
    do anything else in order to create a left-aligned
    single column layout!
