    In this demo, we're going to showcase three different
    single column layouts that you could potentially use
    for a web page.

    (I'd bring up though that you are not limited to only 
    use one single layout on a web page; most web pages
    actually combine multiple page layouts that we'll be
    learning about this week.)

    It's important to have your HTML set up properly 
    (if possible) before writing a single line of CSS
    when it comes to setting up a page layout.

    Containers are an important part of any page layout.
    In our case, since we're going to be creating a 
    single column layout, we're going to need one
    single container to encapsulate our page content.

    Then we'll add some content: just a couple headings
    and a few lorem ipsum paragraphs for the sake of the 
    demo.

    So first, we'll set up our HTML.
