    First off, demo some important properties that
    students will likely want to set up for EVERY
    page layout going forward.

/*
    The asterisk (*) here is referred to as the
    "wildcard" selector; it quite literally targets
    EVERY element on the page.

    The box-sizing: border-box; statement changes the
    way that elements determine their sizes on the page.
    We've touched on this property before in previous 
    drills/demos, but a refresher won't hurt anyone.

    The default is set to 'content-box', which means when
    we set a width of 500px on something, only the content
    is sized to be 500px; the padding and border are not
    included in that 500px, meaning the actual width of the
    element will be more like 500px + padding + border.

    Nobody thinks that way about elements.  So instead,
    we're setting the box-sizing to be 'border-box',
    meaning that the border, padding, and content are
    all included in that 500px we mentioned earlier.

    This way is generally much more intuitive, so we
    want to set this up for every element on the page.

/*
    Here we set a couple more properties that we usually
    want on every page.

    First, we set the body's margin to zero.  By default,
    the body element has around 12px of margin added by
    the browser.

    This means that if we add a background-color to the 
    body (or anything inside of the body), there will be 
    empty whitespace surrounding it.

    Normally when we set a background color, we expect it 
    to cover the ENTIRE background, and stripping off the 
    margin will make that possible.

    Second, we rarely want to stick with the default
    serif font, since sans-serif fonts are usually preferable 
    for screens; even the basic sans-serif is better than
    serif.

    Changing the font-family on the body will affect almost 
    all text content inside of the body, so this is a good
    place to set a default font-family for generic copy text.
