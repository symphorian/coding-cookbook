            This is only a partially completed example of
            what could be the "music playlists" option for
            the Week 1 project, since the completed project
            would basically just be "rinse and repeat" with 
            different content for each playlist.

                Below are examples of how to load up icons
                from the Font Awesome icon library.
                
                Again, remember that you can only use "free"
                icons in this way; "pro" icons (or icon 
                styles) will not load at all.

                And yes, they are choosing to use the <i>
                element as if "i" stood for "icon" instead
                of "italics".  Not the best practice, but
                a very common one across the internet.

                As long as no one puts any content inside 
                of the element, it shouldn't really hurt
                anything, despite not being used as intended.

            For each individual playlist item, we take advantage
            of inline elements like <b> and <i> to
            keep content on the same line.

            To add extra horizontal space between elements in the
            same line, we can be a little hacky (since we haven't
            learned CSS yet) and use the HTML entity for a 
            space (&nbsp;) to add some extra horizontal margin.

            Then to separate content vertically, we use block 
            elements (like <p>) or line break elements (<br>) .
        -->
        &nbsp;
        <!--
            Remember, <img> elements are inline elements,
            so unless you put a block element or line break
            between them, they'll line up side-by-side, 
            with other content, as below.

            Maintaining a consistent height between them all
            will create a very clean looking layout (assuming
            all the images have mostly the same aspect ratio)
