            trouble with icons loading, make sure that the

            This is only a partially completed example of
            what could be the "recipe book" option for
            the Week 1 project, since the completed project
            would basically just be "rinse and repeat" with 
            different content for each recipe.

            For the recipe info section, we take advantage
            of inline elements like <b> and <i> to
            keep content on the same line.

            To add extra horizontal space between elements in the
            same line, we can be a little hacky (since we haven't
            learned CSS yet) and use the HTML entity for a 
            space (&nbsp;) to add some extra horizontal margin.

            Then to separate content vertically, we use block 
            elements (like <h5>, <p>, or <hr>) or we use line 
            break elements (<br>) .

            Below (and above) are examples of how to load 
            up icons from the Font Awesome icon library.
            
            Again, remember that you can only use "free"
            icons in this way; "pro" icons (or icon 
            styles) will not load at all.

            And yes, they are choosing to use the <i>
            element as if "i" stood for "icon" instead
            of "italics".  Not the best practice, but
            a very common one across the internet.

            As long as no one puts any content inside 
            of the element, it shouldn't really hurt
            anything, despite not being used as intended.

            Remember, <img> elements are inline elements,

            side-by-side with other content.

        <h5>INGREDIENTS</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 large egg, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup 2% milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>DIRECTIONS</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 400Â°. In a large bowl, 
                combine flour, sugar, baking powder 
                and salt. In a small bowl, combine egg, 
                milk, butter and honey. Stir into dry 
                ingredients just until moistened.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups 
                three-fourths full. Bake until a 
                toothpick inserted in center comes out 
                clean, 15-18 minutes. Cool 5 minutes 
                before removing from pan to a wire rack. 
                Serve warm.
