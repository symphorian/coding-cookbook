    Now, we're going to making some changes to
    the way that last div "flows" or behaves
    with the content around it on the page.

    But before that, we're going to introduce
    a new property called "width", that will
    make the flow changes a bit more 
    noticeable, and it's a very useful property
    when it comes to customizing your site.

    We're also going to use a different way
    of targeting our HTML.  Before, we were
    using id attributes and id selectors;
    this time, we're going to use class
    attributes and class selectors.

    Classes are actually very similar to
    ids, except that id values are supposed
    to be used only once on a page; class
    values are the opposite: they can (and
    should be) reused as many times as you
    want.

    The term "class" in this context is not
    referring to a class as in our school class, 
    or a classroom.  Instead, think more like
    a classification or category.
    
    For example, when it comes to classifying 
    animals, each animal has a different "class", 
    order, genus, etc.

    Another example might be different classes
    of cars: sedan, station wagon, minivan, etc.

    To use a class selector, we must have a 
    class attribute on the HTML element(s)
    we want to target, and in the CSS, we must
    have a dot (.) in front of the class value.

    Let's give our div a class called 'narrow',
    and target it below, using the new width
    property.

.narrow {
    width: 200px;
