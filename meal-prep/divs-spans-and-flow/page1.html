            Next add two span elements with short 
            text inside of them.

        <span>This is a span</span>
        <span>This is another span</span>
        <!--
            The span elements are on a separate line,
            side by side.  That is because of the
            different flow types of paragraphs and
            span elements.

            Paragraphs are block elements, and spans
            are inline elements.

            Paragraphs, as block elements, take up a 
            whole line on the page, and any content 
            that isn't inside of it is forced to a 
            new line after it.

            Spans, as inline elements, take up only
            as much space as the content inside them
            needs (you can kind of think of them like
            cling-wrap or shrink-wrap); they can also
            sit side-by-side with other inline elements.

            Spans in particular are special, because
            they have almost no styling added to them
            by default.

            Notice the space between the paragraph and 
            the spans? That's because paragraphs have a
            type of spacing called "margin" given to 
            them by default.  Spans don't have that.
