            Now let's add another new type of element called
            a div, short for a Content Division element.

            The div element is similar to a span, in that
            it has no styling attached to it; however,
            unlike a span, a div is a block element.

            Let's look at the differences by adding one
            below with more lorem ipsum content inside.
        -->
        <div>
            Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur 
            adipisicing elit. Natus pariatur dolorem 
            placeat unde? Sed, exercitationem. Saepe 
            neque numquam, quod, quia dolores ducimus, 
            ea illo blanditiis harum perferendis 
            debitis deserunt minus?
        </div>
        <!--
            Notice how the div starts a new line
            underneath the spans, rather than sitting
            side-by-side next to them.  That's because
            of its nature as a block element.
            
            Also, notice how there's no special spacing
            between the spans and the div?  That's 
            because there's no default styling attached 
            to either of them, unlike the paragraph from 
            earlier.

            As a result, div elements are great for
            grouping content together and for building
            custom containers with whatever styling
            we want to give them.

            We'll see examples of that later in the week;
            today, we're mostly focusing just on the 
            Document Flow aspect of divs.
