/* Drill 8 - Write your code solution below */

/*
    This drill focuses on showcasing the fancy
    'auto' values that we can use with margin
    on the left/right sides of an explicitly 
    sized block element to center it within its
    container.

    You should have hopefully covered this with
    them in a previous demo, but if not, then
    feel free to give them more of a hint.

#d8-div1 {
    margin: 12px auto;
}

/*
    Emphasize that this trick will only work
    on a BLOCK element (not inline or inline-
    block) and only when it's been sized with
    the width property to be smaller than its
    container.
