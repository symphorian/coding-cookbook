            We've added one link to our page, now let's add
            another and see how they behave (visually) next 
            to each other.  

            Let's have this one send us to a helpful
            beginner's resource to web development:
            w3schools

            Notice how the anchor elements are side by side. 
            That's because anchor elements are "inline" 
            elements, same as <img>, <b>, <i>, etc.
            
            This would be a good time to ask the students 
            which elements they remember are inline elements, 
            to see how well they're retaining info, and to
            keep things engaging.
