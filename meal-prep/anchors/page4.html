            We've added one link to our page, now let's add
            another and see how they behave (visually) next 
            to each other.  

            Let's have this one send us to a helpful
            beginner's resource to web development:

            Notice how the anchor elements are side by side. 
            That's because anchor elements are "inline" 
            elements.
            
            Do you remember which other elements are also 
            categorized as "inline" elements?












            
            
            (answer: <img>, <b>, <i>, and the other text
            styling elements).
