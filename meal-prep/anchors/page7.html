            We have our anchor elements ready to accept the
            id attribute values that we need, so let's get those
            elements with their ids set up next.

            We're going to use headings for this purpose,
            h2 elements in particular.

            (As an aside, it is good practice to only have one 
            single h1 element on the page; since we're going to
            need several headings for our table of contents, 
            that's why we're not using h1 elements.)
        -->
        <h2 id="section1">Welcome to Section 1!</h2>
        <!--
            We have our heading with an id attribute up above.
            However, if all our sections are visible on the page,
            our links won't actually do anything, since the page
            won't be able to scroll.

            So...we're going to do something very dirty code-wise...

            We're going to add line break elements <br> to 
            artificially lengthen the page.  

            Tell the students to NEVER EVER do this in real code.  
            The only reason we're doing it here is because we 
            don't know CSS yet, and it would overcomplicate the demo 
            to add hundreds of lines of lorem ipsum to fill the page.
