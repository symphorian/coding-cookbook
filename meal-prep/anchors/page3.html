            If we want to be really fancy, we could even instruct
            the browser to open this hyperlink in a new tab
            when we click on it.

            We do this by adding a target attribute, and giving
            it the weird value "_blank".  Now when we click on
            that hyperlink, it will open in a new tab.

            This is actually good practice in website design;
            we generally want people to stay on our site, so
            whenever we have a link that goes off the site, 
            we have the browser open it in a new tab.
