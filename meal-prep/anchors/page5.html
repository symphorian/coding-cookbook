            To separate the anchor elements, we'd either
            have to add a line break element (<br>) between
            them, or put them inside of a "block" element.

            The latter approach is probably the more natural
            solution, as we rarely have anchor elements just
            floating around a web page (unless they're part
            of some kind of navigation).

            So let's create another anchor inside of a paragraph
            element, inline with some text.
        -->
        <p>
            If you want to dig REALLY deep into web dev,
            <a 
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" 
                target="_blank"
            >
                visit developer.mozilla.org!
            </a>
        </p>
        <!--
            Note that because the developer.mozilla.org href
            is rather long, we split the anchor opening tag
            across multiple lines to keep the code clean.

            This is one of the first times we've done this
            inside of another element, but it doesn't matter;
            the indentation rules we follow are the same.
