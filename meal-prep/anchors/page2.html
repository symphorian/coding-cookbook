        <h2>External Page Anchors (Hyperlinks)</h2>
        <!--
            That put some text on the page...but that's it.
            There's nothing indicating that it's a hyperlink, and
            it doesn't go anywhere when you click on it.

            That's because we haven't given it a destination.
            We provide one by using the 'hyperlink reference'
            attribute (href).

            If you're hyperlinking to another page, you generally
            have to put the fully qualified URL in the href
            (meaning you have to include the whole https://...)
        -->
        <a href="https://www.google.com">
            Click me to go to Google's homepage
        </a>
        <!--
            Now we should have a functioning link!
            (Although, for security reasons, the VS Code preview 
            window won't allow you to navigate off your site, 
            so you'll need to right-click in the code and select 
            "Open with Live Server" to test in the browser)
            
            Adding the href in there, even if it's empty,
            transforms the appearance of the anchor element
            to have the default blue color with an underline.
            
            We'll learn how to overwrite that behavior when
            we get to CSS, but for now, we're stuck with the 
            default browser styling for links.
            
            Adding the href attribute in there could start to 
            make the anchor element a little longer than ideal,
            so we split it across multiple lines, like we've
            done in the past, to make the code a bit cleaner.
