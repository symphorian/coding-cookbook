        <!--
            At this point, we have three examples of the 
            first type of anchor, the kind that that navigates 
            us off of the page to another site.

            Now let's find out how to navigate somewhere
            else on the same page (called internal anchors
            or hyperlinks).

            We'll start by putting a heading to label this
            second half of the demo.

            Creating internal anchors/hyperlinks is a 
            little more complicated, because there are 
            multiple pieces involved.

            BUT, it's actually very similar to how we 
            created Internal Links in WordPress, if you
            remember that from the WordPress Wiki exercise.


            For this approach, we must have the following:
                1. elements on the page we want to navigate to
                2. id attributes on those elements
                3. anchor elements with href attributes that
                   follow this template:
                    - href="#id-value", where id-value is
                      the attribute value of one of the 
                      elements we wanted to jump to.

            To illustrate this type of anchor, we're going 
            to build a rather practical "table of contents"
            (again, similar to what you've previously done
            in WordPress).

            Of the three parts or pieces we need for them
            to succesfully navigate within the page, we'll
            start with the last part first: the anchors.
        -->
        <h2>Internal Page Anchors (Hyperlinks)</h2>
        <h6>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="#">Jump to Section 1</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="#">Jump to Section 2</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="#">Jump to Section 2</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <!--
            We now have anchor elements set up inside a list.
            However, by only adding a "#" in the href,
            we've created what I like to call "dummy links"
            or "placeholder links".

            They are functional in the sense that they're 
            properly created and they visually look like
            hyperlinks, but when you click on them, they
            only jump you back to the top of the page.

            Without adding the id attribute values after 
            the #, they don't really do anything else.
