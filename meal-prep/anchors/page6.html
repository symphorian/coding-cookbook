        <!--
            At this point, we have three examples of the 
            first type of anchor, that navigates us off
            of the page to another site.

            Now let's find out how to navigate somewhere
            else on the same page.

            This approach is a little more complicated,
            because there are multiple pieces involved.
            For this approach, we must have the following:
                1. elements on the page we want to navigate to
                2. id attributes on those elements
                3. anchor elements with href attributes that
                   follow this template:
                    - href="#id-value" where id-value is
                      the attribute value of one of the 
                      elements we wanted to jump to.

            To illustrate this type of anchor, we're going 
            to build a rather practical "table of contents".
            Of the three parts or pieces we need for them
            to succesfully navigate within the page, we'll
            start with the third part first: the anchors.
        -->
        <h6>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="#">Jump to Section 1</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="#">Jump to Section 2</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="#">Jump to Section 2</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <!--
            We now have anchor elements set up inside a list.
            However, by only adding a "#" in the href,
            we've created what I like to call "dummy links"
            or "placeholder links".

            They are functional in the sense that they're 
            properly created and they visually look like
            hyperlinks, but when you click on them, they
            only jump you back to the top of the page.

            Without adding the id attribute values after 
            the #, they don't really do anything else.
