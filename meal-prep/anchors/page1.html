            Anchor elements (<a>) are more commonly known
            as links or hyperlinks by the average person.

            There is a technical difference in HTML, however,
            because there is actually a <link> element 
            which serves a completely different purpose.
            
            So try to resist the urge to call anchors "links"
            when you see them on the page; at the very least,
            call them "hyperlinks", but even better to call
            them what they are: anchor elements.
        -->
        <!--
            Anchor elements can be used in two different ways:
            to hyperlink off the page to another website,
            or to jump to another part of the same page.

            The first way tends to be easier to understand,
            so we'll demo that first.

            First, create an anchor with a call-to-action (CTA)
            inside of it (i.e. include a verb instructing
            the user to take some kind of action)
