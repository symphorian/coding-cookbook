    More practice with different kinds of 
    text-decoration values.

    However, notice that for two of them,
    we're targeting anchors and stripping
    them of their default underline styling.

    This is a common practice, as generally,
    the default link styling doesn't fit
    into more custom website designs.

    In order to change anchor styles, you 
    need to be very specific with your CSS 
    selectors, making sure to target the 
    anchors directly, like we're doing below 
    with id selectors.
