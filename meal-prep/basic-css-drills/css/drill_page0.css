/*
    This is another "drill set". To recap from last time,
    students have 3-5 min (at your discretion) to complete
    each individual drill, after which you share a 
    solution for how to complete it; then move on to the
    next one. I recommend debugging only after all drills
    have been completed.
    
    This time however, students will not be writing any
    HTML; they'll only be writing CSS in this "drill.css" 
    file to craft their solutions.

    Note that there is a separate CSS file for general
    styling and the creation of the drills called 
    "style.css"; students shouldn't be modifying that, 
    though they are free to examine it if they choose to.
