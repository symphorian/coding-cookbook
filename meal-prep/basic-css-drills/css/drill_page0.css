/*
    This is another "drill set". To recap from last time,
    you will have 3-5 min to complete each individual drill, 
    after which you should compare your solution to the one
    in here; then move on to the next one. 
    
    This time however, you will not be writing any
    HTML; you'll only be writing CSS in this "drill.css" 
    file to craft your solutions.

    Note that there is a separate CSS file for general
    styling and the creation of the drills called 
    "style.css"; you shouldn't be modifying that, 
    though you are free to examine it if they choose to.
