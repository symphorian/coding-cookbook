    This represents what the students will see
    when they unzip and put the project template
    in their repository.

    The students shouldn't be touching setup.css
    (although they're free to look); for the 
    assignment, they'll be adding their own
    code to style.css.

/*
    NOTE TO STUDENTS: 

    This is the file you should be writing your CSS in 
    for the Bulletin Board assignment.

    Good luck, and have fun!
