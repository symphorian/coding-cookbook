         <!--
            Now, let's create another div. We'll give this
            div a class of featured.

            Then, let's add an h2 that says "Featured Photo",
            and one more div next/beneath the h2 with a class
            of "grid". We're going to create a fun grid system
            that starts at 4 columns but turns into 1 for
            responsiveness.

            Inside of our div with a class of grid, let's add
            a paragraph element with an id of "p1" and put
            "Some of my favorite photos" for it's content.

            After the p element, we'll add 3 image elements,
            each with an id of img1, img2, and img3 respectively.

            We'll add another paragraph element, this one will
            have an id of "p2". And finally, we'll add an
            img element with an id of "img4" after.

            Let's fill in our src and alt attribtues then
            we'll head into CSS.
