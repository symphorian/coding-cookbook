    The CSS is pretty straightforward once you
    have the containers set up correctly.

    However, you will likely need to review the
    different ways of combining selectors
    together.

    Remember that when you have two selectors 
    separated by a space, you're telling the CSS 
    to target what's on the right ONLY when it
    is found inside of what's on the left.

    In the solution below, we are telling CSS to
        "target any Paragraph Elements inside of 
        an element with the 'orange' class",
    which is rather backwards from how we actually
    write it in CSS.

.orange p {
    color: limegreen;
