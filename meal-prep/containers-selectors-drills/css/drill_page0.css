/*
    These drills are a little more challenging,
    as students will need to modify both the
    HTML and the CSS.

    They're only supposed to add the specified
    container elements and classes; they 
    shouldn't be adding their own ids/classes
    to make them easier to target.

    Because their attention will be split between
    HTML and CSS in these drills, you may want
    to consider increasing the amount of time
    they have to work on them to 6 min each,
    or at least be sure to give them the full
    5 min per drill.
