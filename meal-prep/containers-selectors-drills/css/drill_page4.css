/* Drill 4 - Write your code solution below */

/*
    Nothing too fancy here, just making sure
    you're applying the lessons from the
    previous Drills in different contexts.

    In this case, we're showing you what
    happens when you use block element 
    containers to group inline content:

    you can essentially separate them onto
    different lines in different containers.

    (This was actually one way of completing
    the Bulletin Board exerise requirement
    of having post-its on separate rows.)
