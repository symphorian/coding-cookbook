            Ordered lists (<ol>) are typically used for content
            that have some sort of inherent order or numbering, 
            such as rankings or steps to follow.

            So let's create one more ordered list demonstrating
            that concept, with a bit more practical example,
            by adding a heading in there too.

            You can add different content to your list if you 
            want, this is just an example of what might go into
            an ordered list.
