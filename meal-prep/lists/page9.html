            Since all list items in an unordered list are "equal" 
            in terms of their order, unordered lists are ideal
            for content where the order of items doesn't matter,
            such as todo lists, features of a product, or a 
            grocery list.

            Let's go ahead and create our own shopping list
            to wrap up this demo. Ask the students for things
            to put in our class' collective shopping list!
        -->
        <h5>Our Class Shopping List</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken breasts</li>
            <li>Pasta</li>
            <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Chips</li>
            <li>Pretzels</li>
        </ul>

            After completing the demo, rehash the idea that
            certain HTML elements are only supposed to be used
            inside of (or as children of) other HTML elements.

            The ordered list (<ol>) and unordered list (<ul>)
            elements work together with list item (<li>) elements
            in order to create lists.

            You technically CAN use each element on its own, but
            that's not how their meant to be used, and you'll 
            probably get some unexpected behavior as a result.

            Tell students to keep that in mind, as if we see 
            examples of code like this (written improperly),
            students will lose points on their assignments.
