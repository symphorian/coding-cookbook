        <h5>My First Unordered List</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>List Item 1</li>
            <li>List Item 2</li>

        <!--
            Since all list items in an unordered list are "equal" 
            in terms of their order, unordered lists are ideal
            for content where the order of items doesn't matter,
            such as todo lists, features of a product, or a 
            grocery list.

            Let's go ahead and create our own shopping list
            to wrap up this demo. What would you include in
            your shopping list?

            With that, we're done with this demo. What did we learn?

            Well, we learned about ordered and unordered lists,
            but we also learned some higher level concepts too.

            - Elements that have other elements in between their
            opening and closing tags are referred to as "parents",
            or also "containers".

            - Elements that are in between the opening and closing
            tags of "parents" are referred to as "children", or
            also "items"; they should be indented relative to
            the parent.

                In other words, 
                    "parents" are the same as "containers", 
                    and
                    "children" are the same as "items".

            - Some "container" elements are special, and modify
            the "items" inside of them.  And some "item" elements
            are special, and should only be used inside of their
            matching "container" elements.

            The ordered list (<ol>) and unordered list (<ul>)
            elements work together with list item (<li>) elements
            in order to create lists.

            You technically CAN use each element on its own, but
            that's not how their meant to be used, and you'll 
            probably get some unexpected behavior as a result.

            And also, if you do...YOU WILL LOSE POINTS!
