            We'll start off by adding in one list item.

            Note again how we indent one level to the right,
            since we place the <li> element inside of the <ol>
            element's opening and closing tags.

            This is very important for writing clean code.

            If you don't do this...YOU WILL LOSE POINTS
            on your future assignments!

        <ol>
            <li>List Item 1</li>
        </ol>
        <!--
            After adding it, notice how in the preview we can
            see the text we put inside of the list item, but
            we also see a number in front of it.

            That is because the list type we're using is an 
            "Ordered List"; it assumes the list items we put 
            inside have a deliberate order to them, and it 
            adds the numbers to make that clearer.
