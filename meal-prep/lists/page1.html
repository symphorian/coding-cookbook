            In previous demos, we learned about HTML elements that 
            can be used fairly independently. It didn't really 
            matter where you put them on the page, or in relation
            to each other.

            However, today's demo is our first step into more 
            advanced HTML elements that are meant to work together.

            We're going to be demoing two different types of 
            HTML lists today, that utilize a child element
            called a List Item (<li>).

            Let's start off with the Ordered List (<ol>).
        -->
        <ol>

        </ol>
        <!--
            Because I know we're going to be putting stuff inside
            of the <ol> element, I premptively split it across 
            multiple lines, even though there's nothing inside 
            of it yet.

            Notice that nothing shows up on the page yet. That is
            because the <ol> element is a special type of container
            that changes the behavior of the List Items we're going
            to place inside of it (in just a moment).
