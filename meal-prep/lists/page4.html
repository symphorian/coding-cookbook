            Lists also get some additional styling though, that
            may not be immediately apparent.

            Let's add a paragraph with some lorem ipsum text
            beneath it to make it clearer.

        <p>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. 
            Ratione voluptatibus eos harum dolorum excepturi rerum 
            maiores. At excepturi autem itaque vitae fugit, beatae 
            error repellat consequatur ex quas laudantium nobis.

        <!--
            See how the list (in the preview) is indented over to 
            the right a bit compared to the paragraph?

            Lists (by default) have padding on the left side of them, 
            as well as margin on the top and bottom of them.

            We'll further elaborate on the difference between
            padding and margin later; for now, it's fine to just
            think of both of them as "extra space".
