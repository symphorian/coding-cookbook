            Let's add a couple more list items.

            <li>List Item 2</li>
            <li>List Item 3</li>
        </ol>
        <!--
            Note that each list item gets its own line, because
            list items are "block" elements.

            In addition to that, they also get their own number
            in front of them, but the number increments each 
            time compared to the list item before it.
