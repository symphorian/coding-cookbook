            Let's add a couple more list items.
        -->
        <ol>
            <li>List Item 1</li>
            <li>List Item 2</li>
            <li>List Item 3</li>
        </ol>
        <!--
            Note that each list item gets its own line, because
            list items are "block" elements.

            "block" elements are part of a broader web dev
            concept known as "Document Flow", which we'll be
            learning about more next week, but in short,
            "block" elements are containers for content
            that take up an entire line on the page (or
            inside their own container).

            In addition to that, these list items also get 
            their own number in front of them.
            
            Notice how the number increments each time 
            compared to the list item before it.

            That's the magic of the Ordered List element!
