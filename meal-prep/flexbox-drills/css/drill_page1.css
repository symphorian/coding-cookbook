/* Drill 1 - Write your code solution below */

/* 
    This drill is VERY straightforward; they
    just need to be able to identify which
    element is the container, target it,
    and then activate flexbox on it.

    NOTE: it may seem to work if you target
    the container class (.container), but 
    then you're targeting the containers
    for EVERY drill, which will inevitably
    break things in the long run.

    So, make sure to target the container
    unique to this drill, rather than the 
    generic container class, which is applied
    to EVERY drill.
