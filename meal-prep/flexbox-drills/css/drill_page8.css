/* Drill 8 - Write your code solution below */

/*
    This is our first drill focusing on Flexbox
    Items (although Containers are still involved)

    First, we need to make the container a flexbox.

    Then, we need to give each block equal sizing.
    This could possibly be done using width, but
    since the flex property redistributes size 
    based on remaining space, using the flex 
    property on the flexbox items (the boxes)
    makes things a lot easier.
