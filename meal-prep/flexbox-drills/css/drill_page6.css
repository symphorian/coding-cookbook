/* Drill 6 - Write your code solution below */

/*
    Now we're moving on from alignment drills,
    and focusing more on justification, or 
    how we manage space in a flexbox.

    The justify-content property is our friend 
    here, we just need to remember the right
    value to give to it.

    The spacing options are:
        - space-between
        - space-around
        - space-evenly

    space-between is the one we want.
