/* Drill 2 - Write your code solution below */

/*
    Exact same solution for this one as the 
    previous drill, just targeting a
    different id.

    The point of this drill is to show that
    regardless of how much content is inside
    a container, it all can still be moved
    side by side rather easily thanks 
    to Flexbox.
