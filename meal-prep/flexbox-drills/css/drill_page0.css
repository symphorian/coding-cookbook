    Here we have another drill set, focusing
    on the CSS Layout Module of Flexbox.

    Flexbox is probably one of the most useful
    and versatile CSS features of recent years,
    however, it's also the one students 
    struggle with the most.

    I believe a big part of the confusion is 
    the lack of understanding the difference
    between Containers and Items (or
    parents and children, to use different
    terminology).

    So as you go through these and provide the
    solutions, be sure to point our which
    elements are containers and which are items.

    There are only a few properties (and values) 
    that students need to know here to succeed.

    Feel free to review them before starting.

    Flexbox Container Properties
    - display: flex; (to activate flexbox)
    - flex-direction
        - row (default)
        - column
    - justify-content
        - flex-start (default)
        - center
