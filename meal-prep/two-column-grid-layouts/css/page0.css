/*
    This demo is going to feel a bit like dejavu, as
    it's very similar to the demo from the previous
    day of class, but this time we're using CSS Grid
    to do the same things rather than Flexbox.
    
    Once again, we're going to showcase three different
    two column layouts that you could potentially use 
    for a web page, just using CSS Grid this time,
    although we're also going to through in a twist
    at the end with a differently styled sidebar.

    The HTML setup is also exactly the same as yesterday
    just with a different container id name: 
    "grid-layout" instead of "two-columns"
    
    We'll be modifying things towards the end of the 
    demo, so the name change will make more sense then.
