/*
    Remember that margin adds spacing OUTSIDE
    of the border.

    Well, now that we have some borders, let's 
    try out the margin property to add some 
    space between our divs.

div {
    border: 10px dashed red;
    margin: 24px;
}

/*
    Try to think of margin as "personal space" 
    between HTML elements.

    When we set margin: 24px, we set 24px of
    "personal space" around the elements,
    not only between the divs, but actually
    on all sides.

    Each div is now spaced further away from
    each other and from the edges of the page.
