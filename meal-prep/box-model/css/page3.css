/*
    Notice how the CSS Rule below targeted
    ALL div elements on the page.

    That's how the HTML Element Selector 
    works: it's the most general or broad
    targeting that we have access to in
    CSS.

    Sometimes that's what we want; sometimes
    it's not.  When it's not, we may need to
    start combining selectors, to target only
    the elements we actually want to target.

    We'll leave that for another day though.

    For now, this border is rather boring.
    Show the class how we can use different
    widths, styles (like dashed or dotted),
    and different colors.

div {
    border: 10px dashed red;
}

/*
    Now these borders probably look rather 
    ugly, because each div's border is 
    rammed right up against each other.

    Let's see what we can do about that.
