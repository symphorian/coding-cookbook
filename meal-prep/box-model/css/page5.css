/*
    We weren't really looking for margin, or
    "personal space" on all sides; we just 
    wanted it between the div elements.

    In that case, we can modify our margin
    property to only set extra space on the 
    top and bottom of the elements, and set
    NO extra space on the left and right sides.

    To do that, we can provide two different 
    values to margin insteadl of one.

    The first value will be applied to the 
    top and bottom of the element.

    The second value will be applied to the
    left and right of the element.
*/

div {
    border: 10px dashed red;
    margin: 24px 0px;
}

/*
    By setting the second value to 0px,
    we removed the extra spacing we originally
    added on the left and right sides, so that
    now we only have space in between each
    div element's borders.

    Notice that although each div has a top/bottom
    margin of 24px, the space between them is only
    24px, not doubled to 48px.

    Again, that's because margin behaves like 
    "personal space".  
    
    If two people each need 5 feet of space 
    to feel comfortable talking to each other, 
    they're not going to stand 10 feet apart; 
    5 feet between them is fine.

    The margin property of the Box Model works
    the same way.  It basically renders the
    minimum space necessary for both elements
    to be "comfortable", which is usually
    the greater of the two margin values
    between them.
