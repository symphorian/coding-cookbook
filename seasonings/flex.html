            <h4>Basic Code Snippets</h4>
            <code>flex: 1;</code>
            <br>
            <code>flex: 5;</code>
            <br>
            <code>flex: 9;</code>
        </div>
        <h4>Additional Examples</h4>
        <p class="warning">
            NOTE: The flex property is a 
            <strong>Flexbox Item Property</strong>.
            <br>
            <br>
            This property will have no effect if applied to
            an element that is not <strong>INSIDE</strong> 
            an activated Flexbox Container (i.e. has 
            <code><strong>display: flex;</strong></code>
            applied to it)
        </p>
        <p>
            The flex property can be used to specify the 
            size that a Flexbox Item can grow to, relative
            to <i>other</i> Flexbox Items that also have
            the flex property set.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            Actually, the flex property is a shorthand property,
            meaning it allows you to set and configure multiple
            flexbox-related properties at once; however, we're
            going to keep our examples here relatively simple.
            <br>

            end if you want to dive deeper!
        </p>
        <p class="warning">
            NOTE 2: Despite the similarity in name and value, 
            this property is NOT used to activate a Flexbox 
            Container.
            <br><br>
            Only <code>display: flex;</code> can do that.
            Don't get them confused!
        </p>
        <p>
            It can be helpful to think of the flex property 
            as transforming Flexbox Items into a fluid, rather 
            than a solid.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you set the flex property on a Flexbox Item,
            it will grow to fill its container, just like if 
            you poured water into a piece of tupperware.
        </p>

        <h4>No <code>flex</code> Property Sizing</h4>
        <p>
            We'll start by showing you a basic Flexbox Container,
            with no flex properties set on the Flexbox Items
            inside.
        </p>

        <div class="flex-container nowrap">
            <div class="box">A</div>
            <div class="box">B</div>
            <div class="box">C</div>
            <div class="box">D</div>
        </div>

        <p>
            Pretty basic. No growing behavior is present.
        </p>

        <h4>Equal <code>flex</code> Sizing</h4>
        <p>
            Now, we'll give each Flexbox Item the same flex value.
        </p>

        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="box flex-1">1</div>
            <div class="box flex-1">1</div>
            <div class="box flex-1">1</div>
            <div class="box flex-1">1</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            Each of the boxes above have been given a flex value of
            1, and as you can see, they are all equally sized, and 
            they stretched to fill the container.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rememeber that the flex property will size Flexbox Items 
            relative to <i>other</i> Flexbox Items, so if all 
            Flexbox Items have the same value, they'll all be the
            same size.
        </p>
        <p>
            Watch what happens if we give all the Flexbox Items a 
            value of 5...
        </p>

        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="box flex-5">5</div>
            <div class="box flex-5">5</div>
            <div class="box flex-5">5</div>
            <div class="box flex-5">5</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            They look exactly the same size as before, and that 
            makes sense: if each Flexbox Item has an equal flex 
            value, they're all going to have the same size, regardless 
            of how big or small the numbers are.
        </p>

        <h4>Different <code>flex</code> Sizing</h4>
        <p>
            Now, let's see what happens when we give one Flexbox 
            Item a different flex value from the others.
        </p>

        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="box flex-1">1</div>
            <div class="box flex-1">1</div>
            <div class="box flex-2">2</div>
            <div class="box flex-1">1</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            The box with the flex value of 2 is roughly twice the 
            width of the boxes with the value of 1, because the 
            flex property will cause Grid Items to be sized 
            <i>relative</i> to other Items with the flex property
            set.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's try a few more examples.
        </p>
        
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="box flex-1">1</div>
            <div class="box flex-1">1</div>
            <div class="box flex-5">5</div>
            <div class="box flex-1">1</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="box flex-2">2</div>
            <div class="box flex-1">1</div>
            <div class="box flex-1">1</div>
            <div class="box flex-3">3</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="box flex-3">3</div>
            <div class="box flex-3">3</div>
            <div class="box flex-1">1</div>
            <div class="box flex-3">3</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            The sizes of the boxes are relative to the size of the 
            flex values we assigned them; in general, boxes with 
            larger numbers are going to be sized proportionally 
            larger than boxes with smaller numbers.
        </p>

        <h4>Mixing <code>flex</code> with <code>width</code></h4>
        <p>
            The flex property gets even more interesting if you 
            mix Flexbox Items with flex with Flexbox Items with 
            a width.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rememeber, the flex property will size Flexbox Items 
            relative to <i>other</i> Flexbox Items that also have 
            flex properties set.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the width property doesn't work like that; it 
            just sizes an element based on the value we provide. 
        </p>
        <p>
            How does that affect things when we mix the two types of
            Flexbox Items together? Well, let's see. 
        </p>

        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="box width-300px">width: 300px;</div>
            <div class="box flex-1">1</div>
            <div class="box flex-1">1</div>
            <div class="box flex-1">1</div>
        </div>
        <br>
        
        <p>
            In the example above, the size of the first box is fixed
            at 300px (with a caveat); the other boxes with the flex 
            property, however, don't size themselves relative to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other boxes basically figure out what remaining space 
            is left after the box with the width is sized, and then 
            resize themselves using up the remaining space (again, 
            relative to each other).
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            The caveat mentioned earlier is that if the Flexbox 
            Container is too small, it will start compressing the 
            items inside of it, even if that means shrinking an 
            item smaller than the explicit width set on it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's look at one other example to wrap up this section.
        </p>

        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="box width-200px">width: 200px;</div>
            <div class="box flex-1">1</div>
        </div>

        <p>
            This is a good example showing the "fluid" nature
            of the flex property. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The first box has an explicit width of 200px, while
            the second just has a flex value of 1. But as a result,
            that second box grows even larger to fill the remaining 
            space.
        </p>
        <p>
            To use a more realistic analogy, think of the container 
            as a piece of tupperware, and the box with the width 
            of 200px like an ice cube.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Then think of the box with 
            <code>flex: 1;</code> on it like water; as we pour it
            into the tupperware, it fills all the remaining space
            inside around the ice cube.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            That's a pretty good example of how the flex property 
            works when elements with widths are present.
        </p>
