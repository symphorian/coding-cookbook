            <h4>Basic Code Snippets</h4>
            <code>opacity: 1;</code>
            <br>
            <code>opacity: 50%;</code>
            <br>
            <code>opacity: 0.25;</code>
        </div>
        <h4>Additional Examples</h4>
        <p>
            The opacity property is a fun one that affects the 
            transparency of the ENTIRE element that it is applied to.
        </p>
        <p>
            The opacity property will accept values between 0 and 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            A value of 1 (or 100%) given to the opacity property will 
            make an element completely opaque, meaning not transparent
            at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            A value of 0 (or 0%) given to the opacity property will 
            make an element not opaque at all, completely transparent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's check out how these values can affect content 
            on a page.
        </p>
        <div id="example-1" class="example">
            <p class="paragraph-1">
                This paragraph has black text and is 100% opaque with
                <code>opacity: 1;</code>
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-2">
                This paragraph may look light grey, but it's actually black.
                <br>
                Because it has <code>opacity: 0.4;</code>, it is 
                40% opaque (or 60% transparent), so it is actually 
                black mixed with white, which is why it looks light grey.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="example-2" class="example">
            <p class="paragraph-1">
                This paragraph has black text and is 100% opaque with
                <code>opacity: 1;</code>
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-2">
                This time, the black text is blending in with the 
                pink behind it, since it has <code>opacity: 0.4;</code>.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="example-3" class="example">
            <p class="paragraph-1">
                This paragraph has black text, a yellow background,
                and a green border, and is 100% opaque with
                <code>opacity: 1;</code>
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-2">
                This time, the paragraph still has <code>opacity: 0.4;</code>
                but notice that not only is the text partially transparent,
                but the background and the border are as well. 
                <br>
                In other words, the ENTIRE element is partly transparent.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="example-4" class="example">
            <p class="paragraph-1">
                This paragraph has an image inside it, with the same 
                100% opacity with <code>opacity: 1;</code>
                <br>
                <img
                    src="images/egypt-kitty.webp"
                    alt="cleopawtra"
                >
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-2">
                The paragraph also has an image, still with 
                <code>opacity: 0.4;</code>.
                <br>
                <img
                    src="images/egypt-kitty.webp"
                    alt="cleopawtra"
                >
                <br>
                Notice that the image is also partly transparent.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            In summary, the opacity property will make an ENTIRE element 
            partially opaque (or partially transparent, depending on how 
            you look at it). 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you apply the opacity property to something
            and you don't get the result you expect, most likely you're 
            applying opacity to the wrong element.
