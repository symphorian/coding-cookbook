        <h4>Additional Examples</h4>
        <p>
            The box-shadow property allows you to add shadows to the Box Model 
            of an element, as you might be able to guess.
        </p>
        <p>
            Box shadow is a somewhat complex property, but it can have a 
            huge visual impact on your web designs, so we definitely 
            encourage you to try it out!
        </p>

        <div id="example-1" class="example">
            <h5>Offset and Color</h5>
            <p>
                The most basic use of a box shadow involves two things:
                a shadow color, and an offset.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>box-shadow: x-offset y-offset shadow-color;</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                The shadow color is pretty self-explanatory; it lets you change 
                the color of the shadow cast by the box.  This means that if 
                you pick a vibrant color, rather than black or grey, you could 
                create more of a "glow" effect, rather than a shadow.
            </p>
            <p>
                The offset is further split into two separate values: the 
                x-offset and the y-offset.  
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The x-offset shifts the shadow to the right with a 
                        positive value, and to the left with a negative value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The y-offset shifts the shadow down with a positive
                        value, and up with a negative value.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                As an example, check out the code below, and see the effect 
                on the bordered box around this text.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>box-shadow: 8px 8px navy;</code>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="example-2" class="example">
            <h5>Offset, Blur, and Color</h5>
            <p>
                A more advanced version of box-shadow incorporates a blur 
                into the shadow, specifically referred to as a blur radius.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>
                    box-shadow: x-offset y-offset blur-radius shadow-color;
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                The blur radius specifies how far you want the blur to extend.
                Smaller values means there is very little blur around the edges
                of the shadow, whereas larger value cause a LOT of blur (just 
                don't go too big, or you may blur your shadow out of existence!)
            </p>
            <p>
                As an example, check out the code below, and see the effect 
                on the bordered box around this text.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>box-shadow: 16px 16px 8px darkgreen;</code>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="example-3" class="example">
            <h5>Offset, Blur, Spread, and Color</h5>
            <p>
                A even more advanced version of box-shadow incorporates what is 
                called a spread radius into the shadow after the blur radius.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>
                    box-shadow: x-offset y-offset blur-radius 
                    spread-radius shadow-color;
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                The spread radius more or less scales the shadow, causing it to 
                grow for positive values and shrink for negative values.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an example, check out the code below, and see the effect 
                on the bordered box around this text.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>box-shadow: 16px 16px 8px 24px pink;</code>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="example-4" class="example">
            <h5>"Realistic" Shadows</h5>
            <p>
                The box-shadow property is often used as an accent, to make 
                something pop off the page a bit, but usually not to draw 
                too much attention to the shadow itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                To make this occur and feel more natural, think about how "far"
                off the page you want the element you're adding a box-shadow to 
                to feel.
            </p>
            <p>
                For it to feel really high, you'll probably want a large x and
                y offset, with a relatively large blur radius as well.  When 
                objects are far away from what they're casting a shadow on,
                the shadow usually becomes blurry, unless the light source is 
                really intense.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, usually we want the opposite on a web page.  We can't 
                literally make our content higher off the page (unless we start
                dabbling in 3D transforms and perspective), so we usually aim 
                for subtler shadows, only slightly offset and with only a slight 
                blur.
            </p>
            <p>
                To add a cherry on top, we could use a color that is slightly
                transparent; that would simulate a natural shadow even better.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an example, check out the code below, and see the effect 
                on the bordered box around this text.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>box-shadow: -4px -4px 4px #00000033;</code>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="example-5" class="example">
            <h5>Inset Shadows</h5>
            <p>
                An alternate version of box-shadow involves using a special 
                keyword called "inset", which switches the shadow from being
                outside of the box to being inside.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>
                    box-shadow: inset x-offset y-offset blur-radius 
                    spread-radius shadow-color;
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                The inset keyword is optional, and can be used alongside any of 
                the other values.
            </p>
            <p>
                An inset shadow has the opposite effect of a normal box shadow.
                Rather than making content appear to pop off the page, it makes 
                content seem sunk into the page, like you have to look down 
                inside of something to see it.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an example, check out the code below, and see the effect 
                on the box (no border this time) around this text.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 16px 4px purple;</code>
