        <h4>Additional Examples</h4>
        <p class="warning">
            NOTE: The grid-template-columns property is a 
            <strong>Grid Container Property</strong>.
            <br>
            <br>
            This property will have no effect if applied to
            an element that is not an activated Grid
            Container (i.e. has 
            <code><strong>display: grid;</strong></code>
            applied to it)
        </p>
        <p>
            The grid-template-columns property defines columns 
            to populate a Grid Container.
        </p>
        <p>
            Grid column widths can be any length value, 
            whether absolute (e.g. pixels) or relative (e.g.
            percentages); they only need to be separated by 
            spaces in order to set them on the
            grid-template-columns property.
        </p>

        <h4>Examples with absolute widths</h4>
        <p>
            Absolute width values are probably the most
            straightforward to use with a grid, so we'll start 
            an example with those (though they're not
            the most ideal, as we'll see later.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's an example with only two columns defined.
        </p>

        <h4>grid-template-columns: 150px 350px;</h4>

        <div class="grid-container columns-example-1">
            <div class="box">A</div>
            <div class="box">B</div>
            <div class="box">C</div>
            <div class="box">D</div>
            <div class="box">E</div>
            <div class="box">F</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            Above, you can see the two columns of different widths,
            and the Items (A, B, C, D, E, and F) populate the rows 
            and columns one by one from left to right, and top to bottom.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is the normal behavior for all grids, unless some 
            other type of layout property is used (such as 
            grid-template-areas).
        </p>

        <h4>Examples with relative widths</h4>
        <p>
            Relative width values get a little more tricky, because
            you have to make sure those values don't surpass 100% 
            of the Container width, but the nice thing about them
            is they're much more flexible.
        </p>

        <h4>grid-template-columns: 20% 60% 20%;</h4>

        <div class="grid-container columns-example-2">
            <div class="box">A</div>
            <div class="box">B</div>
            <div class="box">C</div>
            <div class="box">D</div>
            <div class="box">E</div>
            <div class="box">F</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            In this example, we have three columns, since we provided 
            three values to grid-template-columns, and this time they
            are relative values: percentages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since we used all percentage values for the columns, that 
            means that the Grid Container and grow or shrink, and the
            columns will grow and shrink with it.
        </p>

        <p>
            That would not occur with absolute units.  If the Container 
            was too big, there would be empty space left; if the 
            container was too small, then the contents would overflow.
        </p>

        <h4>Examples with fractional units</h4>
        <p>
            Relative width values are great for making sure columns 
            grow and shrink with a container, but sometimes we need
            a mix of both rigidity and flexibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enter, the <strong>fractional unit</strong>!
        </p>
        <p>
            Fractional units are still relative units, but they have
            a very interesting behavior (if you've learned about 
            the flex property for Flexbox Items, you'll find they're
            actually very similar!).
        </p>
        <p>
            Fractional units are best described as "fluid"; they 
            resize themselves to fill the remaining space left over 
            in a Grid Container, and also relative to any other 
            fractional units used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's look at a example, using fractional units
            to create flexible left column in a grid layout.
            This might be a layout where you have your main 
            content on the left, and a static-sized sidebar
            on the right.
        </p>    

        <h4>grid-template-columns: 1fr 250px;</h4>

        <div class="grid-container columns-example-3">
            <div class="box">A</div>
            <div class="box">B</div>
            <div class="box">C</div>
            <div class="box">D</div>
            <div class="box">E</div>
            <div class="box">F</div>
            <div class="box">G</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            If you have the luxury of being able to stretch and shrink 
            your browser window size, you'll see that the right column 
            of 250px has a fixed with, but the column on the left
            (with the 1fr value) stretches and squishes based on the 
            space left over.
        </p>
        <p>
            When combined with the grid-template-areas property, 
            fractional units can let us create very useful grid 
            layouts with empty gutters on the outside that center 
            our main content and keep our focus on the center of 
            the page.
        </p>
