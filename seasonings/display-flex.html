            <h4>Basic Code Snippets</h4>
            <code>display: flex;</code>
        </div>
        <h4>Additional Examples</h4>
        <p>
            Flexbox is one of the CSS Layout Modules,
            and the first step to using flexbox is 
            activating a flexbox container.
        </p>
        <p>
            To do so is pretty simple: you just assign
            the display property the value of <i>flex</i>.
        </p>

        <h4>Examples of <code>display: flex;</code></h4>
        <p>
            By default, containers are not flexbox containers,
            so they use normal Document Flow to position items 
            inside of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Block elements have their whole lines and are stacked, 
            and inline elements are arranged in line, same as usual.
        </p>

        <h4>display: block;</h4>

        <div class="normal-container">
            <div class="box">A</div>
            <span class="box">B</span>
            <span class="box">C</span>
            <div class="box">D</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            However, if we take the same code and activate flexbox
            on the container, we'll see the elements inside change.
        </p>

        <h4>display: flex;</h4>

        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="box">A</div>
            <span class="box">B</span>
            <span class="box">C</span>
            <div class="box">D</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            Flexbox containers change the normal Document Flow of
            items inside them.
        </p>
        <p>
            They force all elements into a line (horizontal, by 
            default), so there is no longer any distinction 
            between block and inline items inside of a flexbox.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, flexbox items are not the same as inline items,
            nor are they the same as block items.
        </p>
        <p>
            Watch what happens when we apply some heights and widths
            to our flexbox items.
        </p>

        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="box">A</div>
            <span class="box tall">B</span>
            <span class="box wide">C</span>
            <div class="box tall wide">D</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            Normally, inline elements wouldn't change if we applied
            a height to them, and if we added height to an
            inline-block, it would grow "up", not "down" like they
            did in the example above.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is just a brief illustration that flexbox containers
            and items are their own unique beast in CSS. There are 
            lots of ways to change the positions, sizes, and alignments 
            of flexbox items.
