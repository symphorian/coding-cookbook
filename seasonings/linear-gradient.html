        <h4>Additional Examples</h4>
        <p>
            Let's be very clear to start: 
            <strong>linear-gradient is NOT a CSS Property!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            linear-gradient is a <strong>function</strong> that can be 
            passed as a value to the <strong>background</strong> property
            (well, technically background-image, but we can cheat and use 
            the shorthand property).
        </p>
        <p>
            If you try to use linear-gradient as its own property, you will
            get nothing but broken code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, with that out of the way, let's look at some examples.
        </p>

        <h5>Two color stops</h5>
        <p>
            Gradients are created with values known as "color stops"; color
            stops essentially tell the gradient what colors to transition
            between.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the simplest color gradients is one between two colors,
            so let's do that below with the following code:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>background: linear-gradient(yellow, green);</code>
        </p>
        <div id="example-1" class="example"></div>

        <h5>Two color stops with direction</h5>
        <p>
            Above, we created a linear gradient that goes from yellow to green,
            from the top of the element's background to the bottom. What if 
            we wanted that gradient to go in a different direction?
        </p>
        <p>
            In that case, we can specify the angle of the gradient by the 
            side or corner that we want the gradient to start from by using 
            the special side keywords of "top", "bottom", "left", and "right", 
            as in the examples below.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>background: linear-gradient(to top, yellow, green);</code>
        </p>
        <div id="example-2" class="example"></div>
        <p>
            <code>background: linear-gradient(to right, yellow, green);</code>
        </p>
        <div id="example-3" class="example"></div>
        <p>
            <code>background: linear-gradient(to bottom left, yellow, green);</code>
        </p>
        <div id="example-4" class="example"></div>
        <p>
            We can also directly specify the angle we want using degrees instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>background: linear-gradient(45deg, yellow, green);</code>
        </p>
        <div id="example-5" class="example"></div>
        <p>
            <code>background: linear-gradient(-90deg, yellow, green);</code>
        </p>
        <div id="example-6" class="example"></div>

        <h5>Multiple color stops</h5>
        <p>
            Theoretically, there's no limit to the number of color stops you 
            could give to a gradient (though practically, you'd never need 
            THAT many color stops).
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's an example with multiple color stops:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>
                background: linear-gradient(90deg, blue, purple, lightblue, 
                aquamarine, teal);
            </code>
        </p>
        <div id="example-7" class="example"></div>

        <h5>Color Stops with Length</h5>
        <p>
            We already have a lot of flexibility with linear gradient, but
            what if we wanted even more control? 
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, what if we wanted to create a 
            gradient that stopped transitioning in the middle of the element?
        </p>
        <p>
            In that case, we could provide a length as a percentage value 
            after a color stop to tell it, well, where that color should "stop"
            on the gradient.  Let's see it in action.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>
                background: linear-gradient(90deg, crimson, gold 50%);
            </code>
        </p>
        <div id="example-8" class="example"></div>
        <p>
            See how the gold color transition stops in the middle of the 
            gradient at 50%? That's because of the color stop percentage 
            that we added.
        </p>
        <p>
            You do have to be a little thoughtful with color stop lengths, 
            or else they may not work properly.  As you progress through the 
            gradient, your color stop percentages should always be increasing, 
            since they're referring to points on the gradient.
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, it wouldn't make sense to provide color stop lengths 
            in this order: 20%, 80%, 50%.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the time you've reached the color stop at 80%, you've already 
            passed 50%, and you can't go backwards in a gradient.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's another example of color stops with lengths:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>
                background: linear-gradient(90deg, red 20%, white, blue 60%);
            </code>
        </p>
        <div id="example-9" class="example"></div>
        <p>
            In this case, red only starts transitioning to white at 20%, and 
            white must transition to blue by 60%, so that limits the transition 
            from red to white to blue between 20% and 60% of the gradient.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kinda ends up looking like the Pepsi color scheme, doesn't it?
        </p>
