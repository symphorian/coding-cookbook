            <h4>Basic Code Snippets</h4>
            <code>background-size: cover;</code>
            <br>
            <code>background-size: contain;</code>
            <br>
            <code>background-size: 30%;</code>
        </div>
        <h4>Additional Examples</h4>
        <div>
            <p>
                The background-size property sets the size of the container's 
                background image. The image can be left to its natural size, 
                stretched, or constrained to fit the available space.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is an image we'll be using for a few examples.
            </p>
            <h6>An &lt;img&gt; element</h6>
            <img 
                src="images/axolotl.avif" 
                alt="image to use for background image examples"
            >
            <p>
                The background-size property is always used with the 
                background-image property.  After all, if there is no image 
                in the background, there is nothing to size!  We're going to 
                assume the background-image property is set in the following
                examples, and take a look at some common values used with 
                background-size.
            </p>
            <h5>The 'cover' keyword</h5>
            <p>
                The most common value used with background-size (at least in 
                this course) is the 'cover' value.  This special keyword tell 
                the background image to literally "cover" the entirety of the 
                container's background, even if that means cropping out parts 
                of the image if its aspect ratio doesn't match that of the 
                container. 
            </p>
            <h6>Example 1: The background-size property used with 'cover'</h6>
            <div id="example1" class="example">
                <code>
                    background-image: url("../images/axolotl.webp");
                    <br>
                    background-size: cover;
                    <br>
                    height: 400px;
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>
                However, as you can see, sometimes that is less than ideal.
                Our cute little axolotl in the example above has almost been 
                cropped out of the container!
            </p>
            <p>
                To fix this, we often use a related property called 
                background-position to adjust what part of the image should 
                be anchored in view.  Most commonly, we just center the image 
                horizontally and vertically, as in the example below.
            </p>
            <h6>
                Example 2: 
                The background-size property used with 'cover' and the 
                background-position property.
            </h6>
            <div id="example2" class="example">
                <code>
                    background-image: url("../images/axolotl.webp");
                    <br>
                    background-size: cover;
                    <br>
                    background-position: center center;
                    <br>
                    height: 400px;
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>
                In this case, you can see that the image is still cropped, but 
                it is the edges of the images that are cropped, not just the 
                bottom of the image.
            </p>
            <h5>The 'contain' keyword</h5>
            <p>
                The 'contain' value is essentially the opposite of 'cover'. 
                Rather than making sure that the container is "covered" by the
                image, the 'contain' keyword says to make sure that the image 
                is displayed in its entirety with no cropping at least once
                within the container, even if that means parts of container are 
                left empty or the image starts repeating.
            </p>
            
            <h6>
                Example 3:
                The background-size property used with 'contain' 
            </h6>
            <div id="example3" class="example">
                <code>
                    background-image: url("../images/axolotl.webp");
                    <br>
                    background-size: contain;
                    <br>
                    height: 400px;
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>
                You can see that by default, when 'contain' is used, the image 
                starts repeating or "tiling" to fill the rest of the container.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we don't want that behavior, we can add in another property 
                called background-repeat and set it to 'no-repeat' to turn off
                the tiling behavior.
            </p>

            <h6>
                Example 4:
                The background-size property used with 'contain', with 
                background-repeat and background-color
            </h6>
            <div id="example4" class="example">
                <code>
                    background-image: url("../images/axolotl.webp");
                    <br>
                    background-size: contain;
                    <br>
                    background-repeat: no-repeat;
                    <br>
                    background-color: grey;
                    <br>
                    height: 400px;
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>
                With the repeating (or "tiling") behavior turned off, the rest 
                of the container not painted by the image is left empty.  The 
                blank space can be filled by the background-color property if 
                one is provided.
            </p>

            <h5>Using width values</h5>
            <p>
                Though less common, you can also provide background-size 
                with regular old width values, using either pixels or
                percentages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Width values are useful for when you have a background image 
                that you WANT repeated, and want it to render at a specific
                size.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, suppose we use the image below as a 
                background-image:
            </p>
            <h6>An &lt;img&gt; element of a pawprint pattern</h6>
            <img 
                src="images/paws.avif"
                alt="pawprint background"
            >
            <p>
                The image above is designed to be repeated in a background, and 
                if we use a width value in background-size, we can scale the
                image however we want, and it will repeat seamlessly across the 
                background, so that you can't even tell where the actual image 
                begins and ends.
                (...however, make sure that you provide good contrast for any
                text placed on top of a background like this one!)
            </p>
            <h6>
                Example 5:
                The background-size property used with a width value
            </h6>
            <div id="example5" class="example">
                <code>
                    background-image: url("../images/axolotl.webp");
                    <br>
                    background-size: 250px;
                    <br>
                    height: 400px;
                </code>
