            <br>
        </div>
        <h4>Additional Examples</h4>
        <p class="warning">
            NOTE: The grid-template-area property is a 
            <strong>Grid Container Property</strong>.
            <br>
            <br>
            This property will have no effect if applied to
            an element that is not an activated Grid
            Container (i.e. has 
            <code><strong>display: grid;</strong></code>
            applied to it)
        </p>
        <p>
            The grid-template-area property defines areas 
            in a grid template, based on the columns defined
            by grid-template-columns.
        </p>
        <p>
            These areas must then be assigned to Grid Items,
            and those Grid Items will be slotted into those 
            areas in the Grid Container.
        </p>

        <h4>An Analogy: Rooms of a House</h4>
        <p>
            It may help to think of this property as allowing 
            you to map out the rooms of a house.  
        </p>
        <p> 
            When the 
            house is empty, you can think "alright, this 
            room is going to be the living room, this room 
            is going to be a bedroom, this room is going to 
            be a dining room..." and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, based on those room designations, you start 
            filling the rooms with furniture that fits the 
            room type you decided on.
        </p>
        <p>
            The grid-template-areas property is similar, but 
            instead of rooms, you have grid cells. And instead 
            of furniture, you have HTML elements (technically
            Grid Items).
        </p>

        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        <p>
            The grid-template-areas property has a very strange
            syntax, probably the weirdest you'll see in this 
            entire course.
        </p>
        <p>
            You'll specify grid areas by rows, and the rows of 
            areas MUST be contained in double quotes.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The areas themselves must be separated by spaces 
            within the row (the double quotes).
        </p>
        <p>
            This is easiest to see in practice, so we'll dive
            right into our first exampel
        </p>

        <h4>Simple Example: Three Areas</h4>
        <p>
            We'll start with something basic: a grid with only 
            three columns set, and three Grid Items inside of 
            the Grid Container.
        </p>

        <div class="grid-container three-columns">
            <div class="box box-a">A</div>
            <div class="box box-b">B</div>
            <div class="box box-c">C</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            By default, Items A, B, and C are slotted into the
            columns one at a time; each Item takes up one cell 
            (or room, to use the house analogy) in the Grid.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is kind of like a moving company moving 
            furniture into the house while you're not there:
            The movers have no idea what you're plans are, 
            they just dump the furniture where there's room 
            as they unload it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, let's be a bit more explicit about where we 
            want our Grid Items (i.e. furniture) to go.
        </p>

        <h4>
            <code>
                grid-template-areas: 
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"area-c area-a area-b";
            </code>
        </h4>

        <div class="grid-container three-columns areas-CAB-unassigned">
            <div class="box box-a">A</div>
            <div class="box box-b">B</div>
            <div class="box box-c">C</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            However, just adding the code above won't change anything,
            as you can see.
        </p>

        <p>
            There's a second step to using grid-template-areas: you 
            also need to assign the grid areas to the Grid Items.
        </p>

        <p>
            This can be done with code similar to the snippet below,
            repeated for each Item in the Grid. 
        </p>

        <p class="warning-2">
            (NOTE: grid-area 
            is a <strong>Grid Item property</strong>; it will have 
            no effect if used on elements without a parent that has 
            <code>display: grid;</code> applied to it.)
        </p>

        <h4>
            <code>
                grid-area: area-c;
            </code>
        </h4>


        <p>
            In that code snippet, we're assigning a Grid Item the 
            grid-area of <i>area-c</i> from grid-template-areas. 
            We probably want to assign that to Grid Item C.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            If you want a closer look at how the grid-area property 
            works, check out that page in the Coding Cookbook next!
        </p>

        <p>
            After repeating this for all Grid Items, our new
            grid will look like this:
        </p>

        <div class="grid-container three-columns areas-CAB-assigned">
            <div class="box box-a">A</div>
            <div class="box box-b">B</div>
            <div class="box box-c">C</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            As you can see, our Grid Items are now in different 
            positions. (If you've looked into the order property 
            with Flexbox Items, this is similar!)
        </p>

        <p>
            That is the power of grid-template-areas: we didn't 
            change our HTML at all, but with CSS, we can completely
            reorganize and reorder the Grid Items any way we want!
        </p>

        <h4>Complex Example: Dots and Spanning Multiple Cells</h4>
        <p>
            Now we'll introduce a more complex (and more practical)
            example.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suppose we want a grid layout with empty gutters on the 
            sides, along with a header, a sidebar, and two content 
            areas.
        </p>

        <p>
            That might look something like this, using 
            grid-template-areas:
        </p>

        <h4>
            <code>
                grid-template-areas: 
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". header header ."
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". sidebar content-1 ."
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". sidebar content-2 .";
            </code>
        </h4>

        <p>
            Let's analyze what we have in there:
        </p>
        <p>
            First off, we have three sets of double quotes, which
            means we have three rows we're defining in the template.
            (Note that only the last has the semi-colon at the end!)
        </p>
        <p>
            Inside the double quotes of each of those rows, we have 
            four areas values defined (some are dots (.) and some are
            repeated; we'll get to those later).  That means that 
            we expect the grid template to have four columns in each 
            row (which should have been defined in grid-template-columns).
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, as for the area values themselves: the first thing 
            that stands out are those dots.  A dot is a special value 
            in grid-template-areas: it means that the cell it occupies 
            is meant to be unassigned or empty.  This is exactly what 
            we need for our gutters, which should be empty spaces on
            either side of the main page content.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for the repeated area values (<i>header</i> and 
            <i>sidebar</i>), this introduces a new concept in 
            grid-template-areas: the idea that we can assign an 
            area ACROSS cells.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the case of <i>header</i>, it is repeated twice in 
            two adjacent cells of the same row. That means that 
            the <i>header</i> area will take up the space of those
            two center columns in the top row.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the case of <i>sidebar</i>, it is repeated twice in 
            two adjacent cells of the same column. That means that 
            the <i>sidebar</i> area will take up the space of those
            two cells in the second column, across two rows.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's take a look at how a grid like this would look 
            before and after we define grid-template-areas and
            assign them to the Grid Items (A, B, C, and D).
        </p>

        <h4>Before</h4>
        <div class="grid-container four-columns">
            <div class="box box-a">A</div>
            <div class="box box-b">B</div>
            <div class="box box-c">C</div>
            <div class="box box-d">D</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <h4>After</h4>
        <div class="grid-container four-columns header-sidebar-layout">
            <div class="box box-a">A</div>
            <div class="box box-b">B</div>
            <div class="box box-c">C</div>
            <div class="box box-d">D</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            As you can see, we've completely reorganized the Grid
            Items using grid-template-areas! Let's look at those 
            areas we defined again to see how they match up with 
            the result above (we added a little extra formatting 
            to the code so they line up more nicely):
        </p>

        <h4>
            <code>
                grid-template-areas: 
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". header &nbsp;header &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;."
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". sidebar content-1 ."
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". sidebar content-2 .";
            </code>
        </h4>

        <p>
            See how our grid-template-areas property is basically 
            the textual, visual representation of how our Grid 
            Items look once they're plugged in?
        </p>
        <p>
            A is the header, B is the sidebar, C is content-1, 
            D is content-2, and the dots represent the empty gutters
            on the left and right sides of the Grid Items.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now just imagine how powerful this becomes when we put 
            actual content inside the grid, and not just empty 
            boxes!
        </p>
