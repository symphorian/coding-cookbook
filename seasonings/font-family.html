        <p>
            The font-family property allows us to change the 
            font of text targeted via CSS.
            There are five generic font family names available
            in CSS: serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive, and 
            fantasy.
        </p>
        <h5>serif</h5>
        <p class="serif-family">
            The generic serif font family looks like this. (The 
            generic serif font is usually the default font 
            family in most browsers.)
        </p>
        <h5>sans-serif</h5>
        <p class="sans-serif-family">
            The generic sans-serif font family looks like this.
        </p>
        <h5>monospace</h5>
        <p class="monospace-family">
            The generic monospace font family looks like this.
        </p>
        <h5>cursive</h5>
        <p class="cursive-family">
            The generic cursive font family looks like this.
        </p>
        <h5>fantasy</h5>
        <p class="fantasy-family">
            The generic fantasy font family looks like this.
        </p>

        <h4>Fallback Font Families</h4>
        <p>
            However, most of the time, we'd rather use a 
            specific font family we like over the generic 
            ones offered to us from the browser. But we have 
            to remember that the font we want to use may not
            be installed on everyone's computer.
        </p>
        <p class="verdana-with-fallback">
            So rather than specifying a single font-family,
            which may or may not be available to use, we
            specify a comma-separated list of font families.
            That way, if the first family isn't available, 
            we'll try the next one, and the next one, until 
            we reach the final family, which should be one 
            of the generic families.
        </p>
        <p class="helvetica-with-fallback">
            For example, Helvetica, while popular, is 
            generally only availabe on Macs. So to account 
            for any Windows users, we add a fallback to a 
            similar font called Arial.  And if that one 
            can't be found, then our last resort is the 
            default sans-serif family.
