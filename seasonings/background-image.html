            <h4>Basic Code Snippets</h4>
            <code>background-image: url("../images/flamingo.jpg");</code>
            <br>
            <code>background-image: url("../images/photos/jared.jpeg");</code>
            <br>
            <code>background-image: url("../images/abstract.png");</code>
        </div>
        <h4>Additional Examples</h4>
        <div>
            <p>
                The background-image property is used to add an image to the 
                background of a container.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is the image we'll be using for this example. It works 
                well as a background image because there isn't too much detail 
                in it that would distract from any content we put on top of it.
            </p>
            <h6>An &lt;img&gt; element</h6>
            <img 
                src="images/dark-abstract-background.avif" 
                alt="image to use for background image examples"
            >
            <p>
                Unlike the &lt;img&gt; element (shown above), an image applied 
                via the background-image property has no size associated with 
                it at all. It's as if we "paint" the image onto the container's 
                background (the same background where background-color would go).
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of this, you have to be a 
                little thoughtful about how you used this property.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, in the &lt;div&gt; container below, we added a background-image
                ...but you can't really see much of it at all, because the
                container it was painted onto is very small; it's only the height 
                of the text inside it!
            </p>
            <h6>Example 1: A basic background-image property example</h6>
            <div id="example1" class="example">
                <code>background-image: url("../images/abstractBackground.webp");</code>
            </div>
            <p>
                However, if we stretch out that container a bit with something 
                like the height property, then we can see much more of the 
                image that we painted onto it.
            </p>
            <h6>
                Example 2: 
                A background-image property example with height applied
            </h6>
            <div id="example2" class="example">
                <code>
                    background-image: url("../images/abstractBackground.webp");
                    <br>
                    height: 400px;
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>
                But, even then, there are still some problems. 
                For instance, if you look closely, the image we painted onto the 
                background is repeating itself over and over (a behavior
                which is sometimes called "tiling").
            </p>
            <p>
                To make our background-image behave a bit better, we usually
                have to bring in a couple of its sibling properties, like 
                background-size and background-position.  These properties 
                are frequently found together in CSS code, and work together to
                address the sizing and positioning issues that are common 
                when you ONLY use background-image.
            </p>

                Example 3:
                A background-image property example with other common background
                properties applied
            </h6>
            <div id="example3" class="example">
                <code>
                    background-image: url("../images/abstractBackground.webp");
                    <br>
                    background-size: cover;
                    <br>
                    background-position: center center;
                    <br>
                    height: 400px;
                </code>
