            <h4>Basic Code Snippets</h4>
            <code>display: grid;</code>
        </div>
        <h4>Additional Examples</h4>
        <p>
            Grid is one of the CSS Layout Modules,
            and the first step to using a CSS Grid is 
            activating a grid container.
        </p>
        <p>
            To do so is pretty simple: you just assign
            the display property the value of <i>grid</i>.
        </p>

        <h4>Examples of <code>display: grid;</code></h4>
        <p>
            By default, containers are not grid containers,
            so they use normal Document Flow to position items 
            inside of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Block elements have their whole lines and are stacked, 
            and inline elements are arranged in line, same as usual.
        </p>

        <h4>display: flex;</h4>

        <div class="normal-container">
            <div class="box">A</div>
            <span class="box">B</span>
            <span class="box">C</span>
            <div class="box">D</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            However, if we take the same code and activate flexbox
            on the container, we'll see the elements inside change.
        </p>

        <h4>display: grid;</h4>

        <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="box">A</div>
            <span class="box">B</span>
            <span class="box">C</span>
            <div class="box">D</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            CSS Grid containers change the normal Document Flow of
            items inside them, though without additional grid
            properties set, it can be hard to tell exactly how 
            it changes the Document Flow.
        </p>
        <p>
            CSS Grids essentially force all elements inside of them
            into grid cells, so there is no longer any distinction 
            between block and inline items inside of a CSS Grid.
        </p>

        <p>
            By default, there is only one column in a CSS Grid,
            which takes up the width of the whole container, and 
            each row grows as large as it needs to be for the 
            content inside of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            This results in each Grid Item appearing to act as a 
            block element, but this is not actually the case.
        </p>
        <p>
            Watch what happens when we introduce a new grid property 
            (grid-template-columns) to define additional columns.
        </p>

        <h4>grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;</h4>

        <div class="grid-container-3-columns">
            <div class="box">A</div>
            <span class="box">B</span>
            <span class="box">C</span>
            <div class="box">D</div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            Now our four Grid Items are slotted into three columns,
            and when they fill up a row, they start a new row
            beneath it, and start filling up the columns in 
            <i>that</i> row.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is just a brief illustration that CSS Grid containers
            and items are their own unique beast in CSS. There are 
            lots of ways to change the positions and layouts of
            Grid items.
