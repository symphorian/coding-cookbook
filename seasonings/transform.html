            <h4>Basic Code Snippets</h4>
            <code>transform: rotate(45deg);</code>
            <br>
            <code>transform: scale(1.5);</code>
            <br>
            <code>transform: translateX(150px) rotate(-90deg);</code>
        </div>
        <h4>Additional Examples</h4>
        <p>
            The transform CSS Property is MASSIVE.  There is so much that 
            you can do with it: you can make elements bigger, spin them, and
            move them...and do all of that together!
        </p>
        <p>
            An interesting thing about the transform property though is that 
            it doesn't affect document flow at all.  It's almost like the 
            transforms we apply are an illusion; they will not change how the 
            rest of the page renders at all (aside from possibly blocking other
            elements from view).
        </p>

        <h5>CSS Function Values</h5>
        <p>
            The first thing you need to understand in order to use the transform 
            property is that its acceptable values are called "functions",
            and we say that the values are expressed in "functional notation".
        </p>
        <p>
            What does that mean? Well, let's take a look.  The following
            are different examples of function values that can be given to the 
            transform property.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>rotate(45deg)</code> 
            <br>
            <code>translateY(200px)</code>
            <br>
            <code>scale(1.75)</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are some similarities across the code snippets above:
            they all have a function name (rotate, translateY, and scale),
            followed by parentheses, and inside those parentheses are a value 
            that makes sense for the particular function.  That is essentially
            the syntax for any CSS function:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>functionName(value)</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            What functions can be used with the transform property? A LOT!
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, let's take a look at some of the more common functions 
            used with the transform property, but this is not an exhaustive 
            listing of everything you can do with the transform property.
        </p>

        <h5>The rotate() function</h5>
        <p>
            As you can probably guess, the rotate() function is used to rotate 
            an element by a specified number of degrees.  Let's look at some 
            examples below:
        </p>
        <div class="examples">
            <div id="rotate-1" class="square blue">
                No Rotation
            </div>
            <div id="rotate-2" class="square blue">
                <code>rotate(5deg)</code>
            </div>
            <div id="rotate-3" class="square blue">
                <code>rotate(45deg)</code>
            </div>
            <div id="rotate-4" class="square blue">
                <code>rotate(-90deg)</code>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            As you can see, you can use both positive and negative degree values,
            as long as you specify the units as "deg".
        </p>

        <h5>The scale() function</h5>
        <p>
            The rotate() function is used to increase or decrease the size of 
            an element by a specified ratio.  Let's look at some 
            examples below:
        </p>
        <div class="examples">
            <div class="square green">
                No Scaling
            </div>
            <div id="scale-2" class="square green">
                <code>scale(1.5)</code>
            </div>
            <div id="scale-3" class="square green">
                <code>scale(0.75)</code>
            </div>
            <div id="scale-4" class="square green">
                <code>scale(-0.75)</code>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            That last one might be a little hard to read, but it's 
            <code>scale(-0.75)</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The way scale values work is this: values greater than 1 will
            increase the size of the element, while values less than 1 will 
            decrease the size of the element.
        </p>
        <p>
            To use the examples above, a value of 1.5 will scale the element to
            150% of its normal size, while a value of 0.75 will scale the
            element to 75% of its normal size.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once again, you can see that we can use both positive and negative 
            values, but negative values have an interesting side effect with 
            the scale function: it will flip the element!
        </p>
        <p>
            That last example of -0.75 will shrink the element by 75% of its 
            normal size, but also flip it along both the X and Y axes 
            so that it appears upside down.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also use functions to only scale along a specific axis 
            (scaleX and scaleY), which will have the effect of stretching 
            or squishing an element, as seen below:
        </p>
        <div class="examples">
            <div id="scale-6" class="square green">
                <code>scaleY(0.6)</code>
            </div>
            <div class="square green">
                No Scaling
            </div>
            <div id="scale-5" class="square green">
                <code>scaleX(2)</code>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h5>The translate() function</h5>
        <p>
            The translate() function is used to move an element along a specific 
            axis (or axes).  Let's look at some examples below:
        </p>
        <div class="examples">
            <div class="square big red">
                No Translate<br><br>
            </div>
            <div id="translate-2" class="square big red">
                <code>translateX(100px)</code><br><br>
            </div>
            <div id="translate-3" class="square big red">
                <code>translateY(100px)</code><br><br>
            </div>
            <div id="translate-4" class="square big red">
                <code>translateX(-50px)</code>
                <br>
                <code>translateY(-50px)</code>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Looks a bit messy, right? Let's see what's happening</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second box gave translateX() a value of 100px, so it moved the 
            box along the x-axis, 100px to the right of its natural position.
        </p>
        <p>
            The third box gave translateY() a value of 100px, so it moved the 
            box along the y-axis, 100px down from its natural position.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fourth box used both translateX() and translateY(), providing 
            a value of -50px to both.  That means we first moved it along the 
            x-axis in the negative direction (to the left) by 50px from its
            natural position. Then we moved it along the y-axis in the 
            negative direction (up) by 50px from its natural position. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see, translating elements can result in them covering
            or overlapping other elements.  They are slightly transparent in
            the example, so you can see any overlapping elements behind them.
        </p>

        <h5>Combining functions</h5>
        <p>
            You can actually use the different functions together in a single 
            transform property, and you can get some really crazy effects done 
            that way, particularly once you add animation into the mix.
        </p>
        <p>
            To use transform functions together, you simply add a space between 
            them when you set the values for the property, as in the examples
            below:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>transform: translateX(50px) rotate(45deg);</code>
            <br>
            <code>transform: scale(0.5) translateY(-50px) rotate(45deg);</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            However, one important thing to remember is this: the order that 
            you specify the transform functions matters.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Rotating something and then moving it is different from moving 
            something and then rotating it.  The reason why gets fairly complex, 
            as it has to do with mathematical concepts like transformation
            matrices and vector multiplication.  Feel free to dig deeper into
            that if you're a math person!
