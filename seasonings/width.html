        <h4>Additional Examples</h4>
        <p>
            The width property, as you might be able to guess,
            allows you to specify a width for a particular
            element.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, there are actually a couple different types 
            of units that can be used with the width property,
            along with a related property that you should 
            know about.
        </p>
        <p>
            So let's take a look at how we can use the width 
            property, as well as some of the caveats 
            associated with it.
        </p>
        <h2>Width and Document Flow</h2>
        <p>
            The width property might behave differently than
            you expect depending on the type of element you 
            use it with.  Let's take a look at some examples.
        </p>

        <h3>Width and Block Elements</h3>
        <p>
            The width property is pretty straightforward 
            with block elements.  Let's apply set it with some 
            pixel values to a few div elements along with a 
            border and background.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
            <div class="block block-width-1">width: 150px;</div>
            <div class="block block-width-2">width: 400px;</div>
            <div class="block block-width-3">width: 250px;</div>
            <div class="block block-width-4">width: 30px;</div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Pretty much as expected, each block element is set
            to the pixel widths we set for them.
        </p>
        <p>
            But notice a couple of things: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Block elements always stay on their line;
                    they never go side-by-side, even when there 
                    is room to do so.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When block elements' width gets too short, 
                    the content in them may overflow the width 
                    we specified.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When block elements' width gets longer than
                    their container, the block element will
                    overflow past the edge of the container.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
        <p>
            Now let's take a look at some examples using 
            relative units, such as percentages. It's important
            to remember that when using relative units, they 
            are usually relative to their containers.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
            <div class="block block-width-5">width: 100%;</div>
            <div class="block block-width-6">width: 50%;</div>
        </div>
        <p>
            This also looks pretty straightforward at first
            glance: one block fills 100% of the width of the 
            container, while the other fills 50% of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            ...but if that's the case, why are there gaps on
            the sides of the 100% block?
        </p>
        <p>
            Part of the answer is because the container 
            has padding set on it, so there should be space 
            INSIDE the container before the content begins.
        </p>
        <p>
            But if that was it, then why are the gaps 
            not equal on each side?
        </p> 
        <p>
            Well, that has to do with a rather annoying 
            default behavior of HTML Elements...
        </p>

        <h3>Box-sizing and content-box vs border-box</h3>
        <p>
            There is a CSS Property called box-sizing
            which has a default value of 'content-box'.
        </p>
        <p>
            And 'content-box' means that when we set a 
            width property, we are setting the width of
            the CONTENT area of the element.
        </p>
        <p>
            That means that the padding and border widths
            get added on IN ADDITION to the width that we 
            specified. Which why there's less space on
            the right side.
        </p>
        <p>
            Almost no one thinks that way or expects that 
            when we set a width on an element, so we
            usually change the box-sizing property to a 
            value of 'border-box'.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's try that with our previous example, 
            and see what happens.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
            <div class="block block-width-5 border-box">
                width: 100%; (with box-sizing: border-box;)
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Now the space on either side is equal, and
            that's because the width we set includes
            the border and padding on our box, thanks
            to the 'border-box' value.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, moral of the story: set the box-sizing 
            property to 'border-box' if you plan on 
            using relative width values like percentages.
        </p>
        <p>
            You'll save yourself a lot of headaches.
        </p>

        <h3>Width and Inline Elements</h3>
        <p>
            The width property...is basically ignored by
            inline elements.  Check out the examples below
            for proof.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
            <span class="inline inline-width-1">
                width: 150px;
            </span>
            <span class="inline inline-width-2">
                width: 400px;
            </span>
            <span class="inline inline-width-3">
                width: 250px;
            </span>
        </div>
        <p>
            Since inline element ignore width, we don't
            need to linger. Let's see how inline-block
            elements compare... 
        </p>

        <h3>Width and Inline-Block Elements</h3>
        <p>
            Unlike inline elements, inline-block elements
            behave nicely with the width property.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
            <div class="inline-block inline-block-width-1">
                width: 150px;
            </div>
            <div class="inline-block inline-block-width-2">
                width: 400px;
            </div>
            <div class="inline-block inline-block-width-3">
                width: 250px;
            </div>
            
            <div class="inline-block inline-block-width-4">
                width: 30px;
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            They actually behave very similar to the
            block elements, but unlike the block elements,
            if multiple inline-blocks can fit on the same line,
            they'll slide up next to each other, side-by-side.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from that, inline-blocks are nearly identical
            to block elements in terms of how they respect the 
            width property.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
            <div class="inline-block inline-block-width-5">
                width: 100%;
            </div>
            <div class="inline-block inline-block-width-6">
                width: 50%;
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            ...which includes the same box-sizing issue.
            Thankfully, we can resolve it the same way,
            just by adding box-sizing: border-box; to our
            elements with width set.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
            <div class="inline-block inline-block-width-5 border-box ">
                width: 100%;
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="resources">
