        The grid-auto-rows property is similar
        to grid-template-columns, in that we
        define a part of the grid (rows instead
        of columns, this time).

        However, we're not defining the rows
        explicitly in a template, like we did
        with grid-template-columns.  In the 
        grid-template-columns property, we say 
        "there are X columns with Y widths".

        But in grid-auto-rows, we allow the 
        grid to automatically generate new
        rows as necessary, at the height we
        specified.

    Since we changed the height of the rows,

    So we need to explicitly specify the 
    height as well.

    As we've said before in this course though,
    generally speaking, you don't want to set 
    BOTH height and width on an image, or it
    may get distorted.
