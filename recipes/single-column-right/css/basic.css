/*
    To create a single column layout
    with a right-aligned column:
    
    Step 1 
        Start by setting an explicit width.
        Either absolute or relative units are fine
        (although you'll probably also want to set
        a min-width if using relative units,
        as we do below).

    Step 2
        Next, set a margin-left value of auto.
        This will tell the element to shift all
        of the available empty space to the 
        left margin, effectively pushing the 
        content to the right.

    That's it! We also added a background color 
    below so you can see the boundaries of the column.

.center-column {
    background-color: lightblue;

    /* Step 1 */
    width: 50%; 
    min-width: 500px;

    /* Step 2 */
    margin-left: auto;
}
