                    <h2>Asymmetrical Example</h2>
                    <p>
                        Here's an example of what an asymmetrical design 
                        might look like where you have a large title or some
                        sort of attention-getter on one side, and then
                        additional detail related to the large content on
                        the other side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's almost similar to a slideshow, where you have 
                        a single slide with only the title of the next section
                        on it, followed by several slides of content. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Asymmetrical designs can be especially effective
                        if you repeat them but flip the asymmetry. It 
                        helps provide a nice balance to the page while
                        keeping the layout from getting stale.
