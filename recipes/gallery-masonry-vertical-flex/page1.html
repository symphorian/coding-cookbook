            <h1>Gallery - Vertical Masonry (flex)</h1>
            <p>
                We're going to use Flexbox to create the 
                masonry layout, taking advantage of its 
                ability to orient its content in columns,
                and also to wrap the content in those 
                columns.
            </p>
            <p>
                This approach doesn't result in a loss of
                image detail due to cropping like some of
                our other gallery implementations, so in 
                that way it is superior to those types of
                galleries.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, it is also a bit more "fragile" than
                our other galleries, since we need to specify
                an explicit height.  
                
            <p>
                That means that we can design it to look good 
                for the current set of images at a particular
                screen size, but if we change the number of
                images or decrease the screen size too much, 
                our gallery layout could start looking a bit 
                wonky, or even break entirely.
            </p>
