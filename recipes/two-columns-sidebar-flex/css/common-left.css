/*
    Normally, we'd want to add some padding and/or
    margin to our layout, potentially with borders
    as well.  Also, while the background colors are 
    helpful for distinguishing the two columns, 
    they aren't too aesthetically pleasing.

    So we've made a few stylistic adjustments to the 
    sidebar to represent a more common layout design
    (although it is still relatively boring), along
    with a couple tweaks to the main content as well.

    Note that most of the code is identical to the
    example of a sidebar with two columns using grid.

    For many layouts, either grid or flex implementations
    can be used; it usually depends on what you're
    more comfortable with, and how you need the layout
    to behave at different screen widths.

    Flexbox tends to be more flexible (as you might guess),
    while grids are more rigid; however, you tend to 
    have more control over grid layouts than you do
    with flexbox, so there are always pros and cons.
