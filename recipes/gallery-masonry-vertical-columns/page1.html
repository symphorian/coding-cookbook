            <h1>Gallery - Vertical Masonry (columns)</h1>
            <p>
                To build our vertical masonry gallery this
                time, we're going to use a CSS property that
                is practically ancient relative to the 
                speed that technology advances; the property
                is simply called "columns".
            </p>
            <p>
                Although this property has been around for 
                a long time, it will allow us to create a 
                flexible vertical masonry gallery, avoiding
                most of the shortcomings of other gallery
                approaches, such as cropping images or not
                being able to adapt to different screen sizes.
            </p>
