            <p>
                The one downside to this approach is that it
                is slightly more difficult to add gaps in
                between images (and columns) compared to
                other gallery approaches.  There are some 
                spaces in there by default, but probably not
                as consistent as we'd prefer.
            </p>
            <p>
                The column-gap property will add space between 
                columns at the size we specify, and we can also 
                add margin-bottom to the images to add vertical 
                space between the images.
            </p>
