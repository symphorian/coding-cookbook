/*
    This is an example of how a single column
    layout aligned to the left might be used.

    This type of layout is not very common 
    anymore, as it typically doesn't make 
    good use of the negative space of wider
    screens.  You may find some blogs or 
    out-dated sites that still use it.

    Note that we share the same column styles
    across multiple containers, both in the 
    navbar and in the main content.

    This is a very common way to prevent page
    content (including navigation) from getting 
    too wide on wider screens and monitors.  
    
    This is generally a good practice, as it
    keeps your viewers' eyes and mouse focused
    on the same part of the screen.

    Also, note that the #navbar-column is found
    inside of the #navbar. It is the #navbar 
    container that's responsible for the dark
    blue background color, but it is the 
    #navbar-column responsible for creating 
    the column in the navbar.
