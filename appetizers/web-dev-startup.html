                                First, we're going to 
                                create the necessary folders

                                In Visual Studio Code, make sure you
                                have the Explorer tab open.

                                It's going to look a 
                                little weird at first. Visual
                                Studio Code condenses folders 
                                to one line if there 
                                is only one folder inside of another.

                                On this new line, add the following line of
                                code (feel free to copy/paste it from here 
                                into your code file):

                                the File menu, and then clicking on Save.

                                the faster way by using keyboard shortcuts 
                                (Cmd+S for Mac, or Ctrl+S for PC).

                                That is expected, since there's no content

                                to access the URL, give it another 
                                minute or two and then try again.
