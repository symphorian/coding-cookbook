            <h3>
                A tutorial showing how to include pre-baked fonts 
                in your web page

                Ensuring fonts render the same for every viewer is a 
                surprisingly tricky business.  Some operating systems have fonts
                that others don't, and you have to take that into account when 
                sharing your designs, even in an offline format like a PDF.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a feature of CSS called "web fonts" that allow 
                developers to upload their own custom fonts to servers and 
                create new font families for use on their web sites.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, this process can get a little complex.  You still need
                to worry about licensing, and depending on the font file type,
                it still may not load correctly in certain browsers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thankfully, there are services out there that handle most of
                this work for us, like Google Fonts.  This tutorial is going 
                to show how you can take advantage of Google Fonts to pull
                fonts from their library into your web page.

                                First off, let's navigate to the Google Fonts
                                home page by clicking on the link below:
                            </p>

                                >
                                    fonts.google.com
                                </a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once you arrive, you'll find a page similar to 
                                the screenshot on the right (I have it set to
                                Dark Mode; it may show as Light Mode for you).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As you can see, there's a lot more than just 
                                English fonts available to use!

                                While you can browse all 1550 fonts available 
                                as they choose to display them, it's more likely
                                you have a specific type of font in mind that
                                you want to find.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In that case, you'll probably want to take 
                                advantage of filters like "Decorative Stroke" or
                                "Classification".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For instance, clicking on "Handwriting" under 
                                "Decorative Stroke" will apply a filter to 
                                the search results only showing fonts tagged as 
                                handwriting fonts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You can select whichever filters you want to
                                search for, and once you do, the search results
                                will update themselves accordingly.

                                We would only download the font if we were 
                                going to be creating our own web fonts, or using 
                                it in some other context.  Which we're not.

                            <p>
                                We've made the font available for us to use, but
                                we haven't actually used it anywhere on the 
                                page yet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To do so, look at the code field beneath the 
                                @import one; in there, you'll find the
                                font-family property value that you'll want to 
                                use to apply that font to whatever element you 
                                want to set it to.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For instance, if you wanted to apply the "Ms Madi"
                                font to all paragraphs on your page, you could 
                                write something like this:
                            </p>
                            <code>
                                p {
                                <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-family: 'Ms Madi', cursive;
                                <br>
                                }
                            </code>
                            <p>
                                And that's basically it! You just need to include 
                                the @import at the top of your CSS file, and then
                                set the font-family wherever you want to use it.
                            </p>

                                Notice that Tektur has a LOT more Styles available 
                                for us to use, and each style has its own

                                If we jump back to our "shopping bag", we'll
                                see that those new Styles we selected are now 
                                in there too.

                                Ms Madi is also still in there, just collapsed,
                                so that we can focus on one font family at a time.

                                To use these newly selected fonts, we're going 
                                to move once again to the "Use on the web" section.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And once again, we're going to select the @import 
                                option, and pick the code from in between the 
                                &lt;style&gt; tags.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Note that the code includes references to both 
                                Ms Madi AND the Tektur font styles we selected.

                                So if you want to use multiple Google Font font 
                                families on a web page, you don't need to have 
                                multiple @import lines of code; as long as you
                                have them all grouped in the same "shopping bag",
                                you should only need one single @import line to 
                                make them all available.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="imageContainer">
                            <img 
                                src="images/google-fonts/12_touseagain.png"

                                The @import code for both Ms Madi and Tektur

                                Then, in the code beneath that, notice that we 
                                now have two separate font-family code snippets:
                                one for Ms Madi and one for Tektur.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To be clear, you're never going to use them
                                together like that.  They're only showing you
                                examples side-by-side of how you'd use them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you want to use Ms Madi in an element, then 
                                you'd pick the <code>font-family: 'Ms Madi', cursive;</code>
                                code snippet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And if you want to use Tektur in an element, then 
                                you'd pick the <code>font-family: 'Tektur', cursive;</code>
                                code snippet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And that's basically it! Just remember that none 
                                of the font-family code above or to the right 
                                will work unless the @import is at the top of 
                                your code.
