            <h1>Importing a Code Template</h1>
            <h3>
                A tutorial showing how to get new code into your repository
            </h3>
        </header>
        
        <div class="cookbookPage">
            <p>
                Many Exercises and Projects in this course require you to use 
                code templates provided for you.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Usually these templates are 
                either to ensure everyone's working on the same code, or to 
                give you a more inspiring starting point by using code you 
                haven't learned yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, it can be a little tricky to figure out how to get these 
                code templates into your code repository if you haven't done it 
                before (or maybe you did, but forgot!).
            </p>
            <p>
                Either way, read on!  It's not too bad once you do it a few times.
            </p>

            <h4>Moving things from one folder to another</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <div class="sideBySide">
                        <div class="textContainer">
                            <p>
                                First, you'll need to download whatever code 
                                template you need for your Exercise or Project.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We'll use the very first set of Drills as our
                                example in this tutorial (basic-html-drills.zip).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most likely, your downloaded code template
                                ended up in the Downloads folder.  It'll be a
                                .zip file, which is just a compact file format
                                typically used for sending over multiple files.
                            </p>
                            <p class="indent">
                                (Depending on your computer settings, there's a 
                                chance you might not see the .zip after the 
                                file name.  
                                <br><br>
                                If so, don't worry; it's still the 
                                right file.  In that case, you'll just have to
                                identify the .zip file by its icon or the label 
                                in the "Kind" column, which would say "ZIP 
                                archive")

                                Right-click on that file, and select "Open With",
                                and then "Archive Utility (default)".

                                After unzipping the template's zip file, you 
                                should see a new folder with the same name as 
                                the zip file.

                                If you know where your repository is on your 
                                computer, you can just navigate there yourself
                                in a separate Finder window.

                                to get there manually, then keep reading for a
                                shortcut!

                                Clicking that option should open up a NEW 
                                Finder window, with all the files and folders 
                                we were just looking at in Visual Studio Code 
                                inside it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's important to remember that Visual Studio 
                                Code is just reflecting the state of that
                                repository folder on your computer.

                                If it helps, think of Visual Studio Code like 
                                a special Finder window with a different 
                                visual style, that also allows you to modify 
                                the code of code files.

                                By this point, you should now have TWO Finder

                                What about Visual Studio Code? Well, let's pop
                                back over there and take a look.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After moving the unzipped code template into
                                your Finder window with your repository, you 
                                should now also see that unzipped folder in 
                                Visual Studio Code.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And that makes sense, because Visual Studio 
                                Code is just reflecting the state of that

                                We moved something new into that folder, so

                                Yup, that's the stuff we'd expect to have in 
                                there for basic-html-drills: a css folder, an

                                Most of your code templates will probably have 
                                a similar structure as this one, just with

                                    in a "temporary" state will have its name 
                                    in italics in the tab that opens up.
