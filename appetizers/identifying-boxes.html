                It's one thing to know how to code a web page for yourself, 
                but quite another to know how to build out a design mockup 
                given to you by a client.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your first instinct may be to hop right into coding and try to
                build it from top to bottom, but rarely does that work out well
                for new developers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of diving into HTML and CSS, we want to encourage you to 
                pause and analyze the layout of whatever you plan to build
                first; understanding the layout and planning how to group 
                content together BEFORE starting to code can save you a lot of
                time and frustration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's take a look at one of the projects you'll be completing
                in this course, and see how we can identify the different 
                groupings of content and think about the HTML element boxes 
                they could belong to.
            </p>

        <div class="cookbookPage">
            <h2 id="part1" class="invisibleAnchorTarget"></h2>
            <h6>Project 2</h6>
            <h2>The Generic License</h2>
            <h4>Your First CSS Project</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <div class="sideBySide">
                        <div class="textContainer">
                            <p>
                                For whatever reason, license layouts always seem
                                to look awful; not sure if it's a deliberate 
                                choice in order to make it harder to create 
                                fakes, or they just didn't want to spend the 
                                money to hire a good designer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But on the flip side, that means we're not going 
                                to be grading too harshly on your first CSS 
                                project, since our starting point is a pretty 
                                low bar!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To the right, you'll see the generic license 
                                layout that we're aiming for.  This might look a 
                                tad complex, but let's see how we can break this 
                                design down into smaller pieces that will be
                                easier to digest (mentally).
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="imageContainer">
                            <img 
                                src="images/identifying-boxes/complete_cropped.png" 
                                alt="A completed version of the project"
                            >
                            <figcaption>A completed version of the project</figcaption>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="sideBySide">
                        <div class="textContainer">
                            <p>
                                Our approach to breaking this design down is 
                                going to be starting with the largest chunks of
                                content, and then seeing how we can break them 
                                down into smaller chunks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our largest chunk is the entire license itself,
                                represented by the large red box surrounding
                                the whole license.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Remember, every HTML Element is ultimately just 
                                a box, which can be further broken down into the
                                CSS Box Model components of margin, border,
                                padding, and content.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a result, each box that we draw in this walkthrough will
                                represent an HTML element.  
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                Most of the time, 
                                the large boxes grouping big chunks of
                                content will be &lt;div&gt; elements.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="imageContainer">
                            <img src="images/identifying-boxes/help_01.png" alt="vscodeapp.png">
                            <figcaption>
                                The largest (red) box, representing the largest grouping
                                of content
                            </figcaption>
                        </div>
                        
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="sideBySide">
                        <div class="textContainer">
                            <p>
                                Next, we identify the smaller 
                                groupings of content
                                inside of the large red box.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are different ways of 
                                breaking up the content
                                inside, but I recommend going one line at a time
                                down the design and applying this rule:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>
                                    If it's on its own line, 
                                    it can get its own box.
                                    <br>
                                    However, if it's side-by-side 
                                    with something else,
                                    then that content and 
                                    whatever it's side-by-side
                                    with should have their own boxes (sometimes
                                    within a larger box for the whole line).
                                </em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You can see that logic applied by looking
                                at the smaller red boxes to the right:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The FLORIDA heading on the top is one box</li>
                                    <li>And beneath that are two side-by-side boxes</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The larger left box with all the driver info</li>
                                        <li>
                                            And the smaller right box with the larger image 
                                            and REAL-ID and donor info 
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </ul>
                            </p>

                                broken down into smaller chunks, so we'll leave
                                that and move on to the other boxes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let's tackle the left box first.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        The DRIVER LICENSE text is all on its
                                        own line, so it gets its own box.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The License No. and Expiration date are
                                        side-by-side, but are similarly styled,
                                        so we'll give them a single container box 
                                        and box them separately later.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The address is not side-by-side anything,
                                        so it can get its own box.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The final chunk has lots of side-by-side 
                                        content, so we'll put that all in one 
                                        container box as well, and split them 
                                        up later.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now let's rinse and repeat for all the side-by-side 
                                content in THOSE boxes!
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="imageContainer">
                            <img src="images/identifying-boxes/help_03.png" alt="extensionssearch.png">

                                Green boxes representating additional HTML Elements 
                                inside of the left red box
                            </figcaption>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="sideBySide">
                        <div class="textContainer">
                            <p>
                                First, we have the license number and expiration
                                date.  Since those are side-by-side, they get their
                                own boxes. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The next box with side-by-side content is the bottom
                                green one.  This one has quite a lot going on inside
                                of it, but again, we're only going to focus on the 
                                groupings of content inside, and split them up one 
                                chunk at a time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The image is the first chunk; that's pretty straightforward.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You might be tempted to break up the remaining content into
                                even smaller chunks at this point, but look closely: ALL of
                                it is side-by-side with the image.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That means that ALL of
                                it should be put into a container box next to that image.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="imageContainer">
                            <img 
                                src="images/identifying-boxes/help_04.png"

                            <figcaption>
                                Light blue boxes representing additional content 
                                boxes inside of the green boxes
                            </figcaption>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="sideBySide">
                        <div class="textContainer">
                            <p>
                                Now we keep going, looking at how to break down 
                                the content inside of the light blue box. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At this juncture, there's another couple ways that
                                we could split things up.  We could give each 
                                line of side-by-side content its own box. Or, we
                                could group each side of the side-by-side content
                                into its own box.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We're going to opt for the latter,
                                although there's no significant difference from
                                the former.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then, we finally have that signature at the bottom,
                                and since it takes up its own line, it gets its
                                own box.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="imageContainer">
                            <img 
                                src="images/identifying-boxes/help_05.png" 
                                alt="Dark blue boxes representing additional content" 
                            />
                            <figcaption>
                                Dark blue boxes representing additional content 
                                boxes inside of the light blue boxes
                            </figcaption>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="sideBySide">
                        <div class="textContainer">
                            <p>
                                Finally, we have to break up the left and right 
                                sides of the side-by-side boxes into their own boxes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Again, everything that has its own line inside of
                                the box gets its own box, so basically every field
                                of data gets its own box.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Technically, we should go even further, since each 
                                field name and value have different styles. But
                                we've pretty much ran out of space to draw more 
                                boxes, so we'll
                                leave that to you when you work on this!
                            </p>

                                However, we're not done yet! Everything we've been 
                                doing for the last few steps has only been for 
                                the left red box; we still have the right red box
                                to break up!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thankfully, there's less content in the right 
                                side, so it will be simpler to break up.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The image has its own line, so it gets its own 
                                box.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then we have the line of side-by-side content 
                                for the donor and REAL-ID, so they get their own
                                box too.
                            </p>

                                Then, we can give the donor and REAL-ID their
                                own boxes as well, since they're side-by-side.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And with that, we're finally done breaking up 
                                the content into those smaller chunks.
                            </p>

                                It may look a lot messier now, but that's 
                                actually how the HTML is going to be structured.  
                                Remember, every box we've drawn represents an 
                                HTML Element container.

                            <p>
                                But that doesn't mean we went through this exercise in vain!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you can still "see" these boxes when you look at the design,
                                it'll be that much easier for you to "see" their matching 
                                HTML elements in the code.
                            </p>

                                What's more, the template you'll get for the project has NO CSS 
                                styling written for the license.  The image to the 
                                right is what you're going to see when previewing 
                                the template. Yikes!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This may look pretty intimidating, but we've already 
                                taught you the approach that will allow you to
                                succeed:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Style the license in the same way we broke down 
                                the content boxes, starting with the outermost 
                                boxes and working your way inward, 
                                one level at a time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most of the time, this will be a much easier and more 
                                straightforward approach than doing it some other
                                way.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="imageContainer">

                                alt="Light blue boxes representing additional content"

                                The license with no styling whatsoever

                        </div>
                    </div>

                        <div class="textContainer">
                            <p>
                                To begin, start by defining the styles 
                                for the whole license container. (A width
                                of 700px with a rounded border is a good 
                                starting point!)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then set up the containers for the inner 
                                red boxes: the FLORIDA one is a pretty basic 
                                block container, but the ones representing the 
                                left and right red boxes need to be placed 
                                side-by-side, so those will probably need to be 
                                inline-blocks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This will still look pretty messy at first; 
                                just look at the image on the right for proof.
                                But it's a small step closer. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then rinse and repeat for the remaining boxes: if they get an
                                entire line on their own, use a block element; otherwise, use 
                                an element that you configure to be an inline-block to get them
                                side-by-side.
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                And as you apply the styling to the boxes based 
                                on the groupings and layout we identified earlier, 
                                slowly but surely, you'll see that design from
                                the mockups coming to life.
