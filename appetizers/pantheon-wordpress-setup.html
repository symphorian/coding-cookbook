                                In order to create a web site on the Internet,
                                you first need to find someone/something to host it 
                                for you.
                            </p>

                                For most of the course, GitHub Pages has been 
                                our hosting provider, creating a web site for us
                                from all the HTML and CSS we've written.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, GitHub Pages cannot host something as 
                                dynamic and complex as a CMS, so we need to use 
                                an altenate hosting provider.

                                The hosting provider we're going to be using
                                for this first week of CMS is 
                                called <b>Pantheon</b>.

                                create our Pantheon site, we can begin building
                                (installing) our house (WordPress).

                                This is going to get confusing later if you
                                don't pay attention, because we're also
                                going to have a <b>WordPress</b> Dashboard.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The <b>Pantheon Site</b> Dashboard is how you 
                                manage and monitor the hosting status of your 
                                site.  It is also how you access your 
                                WordPress site.

                                This page looks pretty busy, but there's really 
                                only two buttons 
                                you need to worry about in this course:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Site Admin</li>
                                    <li>Clear Caches</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The [Site Admin] button is important for 
                                <em>working</em> on assignments.
                            </p>

                                The [Clear Caches] button is important for

                                There is a way to reset it, but it involves
                                diving deep into the database and modifying 
                                the data inside, which is a complex and 
                                somewhat risky process.

                                click on the little home icon at the top left
                                of the Dashboard, next to the name of your site.

                                After clicking the home icon, you'll be 
                                brought to the Home page of your WordPress 
                                site.

                                This is actually your WordPress site, but
                                at the moment, there's still a lot of placeholder
                                content, such as "Mindblown: a blog about 
                                philosophy" in the screenshot to the right; 
                                this content is set using the default
                                WordPress Theme, which changes every year.

                                Don't worry, as you'll see soon, we can
                                customize all of this! For now, just ignore 
                                the default Theme content.

                                Notice how the home icon in the top left 
                                changed into a little speedometer icon instead.
                                Clicking on this icon will bring you back to 
                                the Dashboard.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That icon can be helpful in letting 
                                you know whether you can share a page with
                                someone else.

                                        If it's a speedometer icon (indicating
                                        you're NOT in the Dashboard), then 
                                        you can share that URL with other
                                        people.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        If it's a home icon (indicating you 
                                        ARE on the Dashboard), then you can't 
                                        share that URL with other people, 
                                        since they won't be able to access it.
