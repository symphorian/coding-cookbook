        <h3 id="intenral">Internal Hyperlinks</h3>
        <p>
            When you click on an internal hyperlink, you will stay on the 
            current page, but will be navigated to a particular HTML element 
            on a different part of the page.  This type of anchor is often 
            used for something like a Table of Contents, that enables a website 
            visit to jump down to the part of the page they care about.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to use anchor elements to create an internal hyperlink, 
            you'll need to do two things:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                On the element you want to link to, set up an id attribute.
                (For example: id="where-i-want-to-jump-to")
            </li>
            <li>
                On the anchor you want to link from, grab the id attribute 
                value you just set up, set that in the anchor's href 
                attribute, and put a # in front of it.
                (For example: href="#where-i-want-to-jump-to")
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Lower down on this page are three "sections" that we've created, 
            each with their own id attribute values of "section1", "section2", and 
            "section3".  We'll use those id values in our example below.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="#section1">Go to Section 1</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="#section2">Go to Section 2</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="#section3">Go to Section 3</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Notice in the code that the three anchors above have their hrefs 
            set to "#section1", "#section2", and "#section3" respectively.
            The hashtag/pound symbol (#) in front of the id values is REQUIRED;
            without that, the code will be interpreted as an <i>external</i>
            hyperlink, and probably won't work.
        </p>
        <p>
            And the three h3 headings further down have matching id attribute 
            values of "section1", "section2", and "section3". 
            Try clicking on the anchors and see how they jump you down to
            the headings with the matching ids.
        </p>
        <h4>Structuring a Table of Contents</h4>
        <p>
            As a side note, if you have several anchors in a row, in something 
            like a Table of Contents or some form of navigation, we usually 
            don't want them all lined up in a row, as they would naturally,
            since they're inline elements.
            Instead, we probably want them separated in an orderly way,
            likely on separate lines.
        </p>
            Because of this, we often put anchor elements inside of other 
            elements for better spacing and layouts, such as the Unordered List 
            element and List Item elements we used in the example above.
        </p>
