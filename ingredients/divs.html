            Div elements are the most basic block element in HTML.
        </div>
        <div>
            As a reminder, block elements are usually used as containers 
            for other elements. Block elements fill up all the horizontal 
            space on the page (or inside their containers), and force 
            a line break after the content inside them ends. 
        </div>
        <div>
            Div elements have no styling at all, and as a result, they
            can be considered the purest kind of container in HTML.
        </div>
        <div>
            You can put 
            <span>inline elements</span>
            inside of divs.
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>You can also put other block elements inside.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            Or you can even include a mix of
            <span>inline elements</span>
            <p>and block elements.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            The content inside a div will be grouped together in 
            the code, but unless you use some kind of styling to 
            represent that visually, you probably won't be 
            able to tell on the page.
        </div>
        <div id="colorful">
            <h4>A Colorful Example</h4>
            <p>
                Here is a simple example of how a div can be 
                used to group content together stylistically
                (with a little help from some CSS).
            </p>
            <p>
                I changed the background, as well as the color 
                and font family of all the text in this div.
            </p>
