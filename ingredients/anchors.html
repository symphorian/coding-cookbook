            The anchor element (also known as a link or hyperlink) can be used 
            to navigate the user to a different location on the current page,
            or to a different page entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, anchor elements are inline elements, meaning they will
            appear "in line" with other text around them.  So if we add three 
            anchor elements right here:
            <a href="anchors-external.html">External Hyperlinks</a>
            <a href="anchors-internal.html">Internal Hyperlinks</a>
            <a href="#">Dummy Anchor</a>
            They will all line up right next to each other, even though if you 
            look in the code, you'll see they're on separate lines.
        </p>
        <p>
            To use anchor elements, you will need to provide a hyperlink 
            reference, or 'href', attribute.  Depending on what you provide to 
            the href attribute, you can create either an 
            <b>external hyperlink</b> or an <b>internal link</b>.
            Because these concepts can get rather complex, we have split them 
            up into their own Cookbook pages.
