        <p>
            The anchor element (also known as a link or hyperlink) can be used 
            to navigate the user to a different location on the current page,
            or to a different page entirely, as in the example below.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">
                Click me to visit Google's home page
            </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            To use anchor elements, you will need to provide a hyperlink 
            reference (href) attribute.  If you want to link to a different 
            page, you can just provide the URL you want to link to (although,
            if you're navigating a user off of your site, it is generally 
            good practice to open that page in another tab.  You can do so 
            by including this attribute name and value: target="_blank")
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, anchor elements are inline elements, meaning they will
            appear "in line" with other text around them.  So if we add three 
            anchor elements right here:
            <a href="#section1">Go to Section 1</a>
            <a href="#section2">Go to Section 2</a>
            <a href="#section3">Go to Section 3</a>
            They will all line up right next to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            That usually isn't what we want, so we often put anchor elements
            inside of other elements for better spacing and layouts. For 
            instance, an unordered list:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="#section1">Go to Section 1</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="#section2">Go to Section 2</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="#section3">Go to Section 3</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you want to use anchor elements to link to another part of 
            the page, you'll need to do two things:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                On the element you want to link to, set up an id attribute 
            </li>
            <li>
                On the anchor you want to link from, grab the id attribute 
                value of the element you want to link to, and set that in 
                the anchor's href attribute, and put a # in front of it.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            For example the three anchors above have their hrefs set to 
            "#section1", "#section2", and "#section3" respectively.
            And the three headings below have matching id attribute 
            values of "section1", "section2", and "section3". Try 
            clicking on the anchors and see how they jump you down to
            the headings with the matching ids.
        </p>
        <h3 id="section1">Section 1</h3>
        <p class="extraSpace"></p>
        <h3 id="section2">Section 2</h3>
        <p class="extraSpace"></p>
        <h3 id="section3">Section 3</h3>
        <p class="extraSpace"></p>
    </body>
