            Font Awesome icon library.  Remember that only
            "free" icons can be loaded in this way; "pro"
            icons won't show up at all, so if you have
            trouble with icons loading, make sure that the 
            icon itself (and its style) are not "pro".

        <h1>Icon Library Example (Font Awesome)</h1>
        <p>
            Icon libraries are collections of prepackaged 
            code that you can include on your page,
            so that you can use icons that someone else 
            has already created.
        </p>
        <p>
            The icon library in this example come from a 
            site called 
            <a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons" target="_blank">
                Font Awesome
            </a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Instructions to Use</h3>
        <p>
            To use the Font Awesome Library on your page,
            simply copy the code below in its entirety 
            and paste it in your &lt;head&gt; element, 
            right below your &lt;title&gt; element
            (and for clean code, split up the attributes
            across multiple lines; you can't help the 
            length of the attributes going over 80
            characters, but you can at least make them
            easier to read).
        </p>
        <code>
            &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.2.0/css/all.min.css" integrity="sha512-xh6O/CkQoPOWDdYTDqeRdPCVd1SpvCA9XXcUnZS2FmJNp1coAFzvtCN9BmamE+4aHK8yyUHUSCcJHgXloTyT2A==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" /&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
            Now you'll be able to use the icon code from 
            Font Awesome to load icons from their library 
            on your page!
        </p>
        <h3>Where to Find and How to Use the Library's Icons</h3>
        <p>
            Over 2000 icons are available for free at
            <a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons/" target="_blank">
                https://fontawesome.com/icons/
            </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Just enter your search term in the search bar,
            and then filter by "Free" icons.
        </p>
        <img 
            src="images/fontawesome_iconcode_freefilter.png"
            alt="where to find the code for a Font Awesome icon"
            width="600"
        >
        <p>
            After searching, click on the icon you want to use;
            then in the dialog that pops up, simply copy the 
            code in the HTML tab at the bottom and paste it 
            in your code.
        </p>
        <img 
            src="images/fontawesome_iconcode.png"
            alt="where to find the code for a Font Awesome icon"
            width="600"
        >
        <p>
            If your icon says "PRO" in the top left corner,
            it will not load if you attempt to use them.
            Note that changing to a different style of icon 
            can change it from free to "PRO".
        </p>
        
        <img 
            src="images/fontawesome_iconcode_pro.png"
            alt="where to identify if your icon is a PRO icon"
            width="600"
        >
        <h3>Basic Examples</h3>
        <p>
            Here are some examples of some icons you 
            might use from the icon library:
            <i class="fa-solid fa-house"></i>
            <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i>
            <i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i>
            <i class="fa-brands fa-instagram"></i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the icons are inline elements,
            since they're using the &lt;i&gt; element.
            So they show up side-by-side (or in-line)
            with the text and elements around them.
        </p>
        <p>
            And yes, they are choosing to use the &lt;i&gt;
            element as if "i" stood for "icon" instead
            of "italics".  Not the best practice, but
            a very common one across the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since they are inline elements,
            <br>
            <i class="fa-solid fa-music"></i>
            you can put icons on either side of a 
            chunk of text
            <i class="fa-solid fa-music"></i>
            <br>
            and you can break up the lines using the 
            line break element (&lt;br&gt;).
        </p>
        <h3>Practical Examples</h3>
