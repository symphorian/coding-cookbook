        The ordered list (&lt;ol&gt;) element is always paired with 
        list item (&lt;li&gt;) elements as children. In ordered lists,
        list items have numbers in front of them by default.

        <ol>
            <li>List Item 1</li>
            <li>List Item 2</li>
            <li>List Item 3</li>
            <li>List Item 4</li>
            <li>List Item 5</li>
        </ol>

        Ordered lists have default margin and padding applied to them.
        They are frequently used to display information that has an
        order to it, such as rankings or steps in a recipe.
