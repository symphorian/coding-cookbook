        <h3>External Hyperlinks</h3>
        <p>
            When you click on an external hyperlink, you will be taken off the 
            current page and navigated to a new page.  This new page may be on 
            the same website, or a different one entirely.
        </p>
        <h4>External Hyperlinks to pages on the same site</h4>
        <p>
            If you want to create an external hyperlink that goes to a
            different page on the same site, you can just provide the anchor's 
            href attribute with a filepath to the HTML file that you want to 
            navigate to. (e.g. href="other-page.html")
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, the anchor below links to another Cookbook page about 
            the audio HTML element, which is in the same folder as this page 
            about anchors.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="audio.html">
                Click me to visit the Audio Element page in the Cookbook
            </a>
        </p>
        <h5>Hyperlinking to HTML files in the same folder</h5>
        <p>
            Note the last phrase in the description above: that the 
            audio HTML file was in the same folder as this file.  When HTML
            files that we want to link to are in the same folder, that makes
            things relatively simple, and the href attribute just needs to be 
            provided with the file name, like this: href="audio.html"
        </p>
        <h5>Hyperlinking to HTML files in a different folder</h5>
        <p>
            However, if the page you want to create a hyperlink to is NOT in the 
            same folder as the HTML file you're working in, then things get a 
            bit more complicated.  You'll likely have to add a dot-dot-slash 
            (../) to the front of the file path to tell the file to look outside 
            of the current folder and then access the necessary file (or folder)
            name.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, the anchor below creates a hyperlink to the HTML 
            Dirty Code Report (a very handy tool for writing clean HTML code!), 
            but since that HTML file is not in the same folder as this file, 
            the filepath we provide needs to include "../" to go out of the 
            current folder in order to navigate to that file: 
            href="../html-checker.html"
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="../html-checker.html">
                Click me to visit the HTML Dirty Code Report in the Cookbook
            </a>
        </p>
        <h4>
            External Hyperlinks to pages on a different site
        </h4>
        <p>
            If you want to create an external hyperlink that goes to a
            page on an entirely different site, you can just provide the href 
            attribute with the URL that you want to go to.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, if you're navigating a user off of your site, it is 
            generally good practice to open that page in another tab.  
            You can do so by including a rather strange looking attribute and
            value pair: target="_blank"
        </p>
        <p>
            The anchor below links to Google's homepage AND opens the page in 
            a new tab using the target attribute with the "_blank" value.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">
                Click me to visit Google's home page
            </a>
        </p>
