        This text is not bold.

        <b>This text is bold.</b>

        <b>
            This text is also bold.
        </b>

        Note how all this text is all on the same line.

        That is because the &lt;b&gt; element is an 
        <b>inline</b>
        element, so regardless of how we format the code,
        it will all be on the same line on the page
        (unless the line wraps).
