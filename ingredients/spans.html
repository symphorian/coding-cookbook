        <p>
            <span>Span elements</span> are the most basic inline 
            element in HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a reminder, inline elements are place "in line" with 
            other elements on the same line (usually text). Span 
            elements themselves often contain text that we want to 
            apply specific styles to, separate from the other text 
            on the same line.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similar to div elements, <span>span elements</span> have 
            no styling at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            The content inside a span element will be grouped 
            inline in the code, but unless you use some kind of 
            styling to distinguish it visually, you probably won't 
            be able to tell on the page.

        <h4><span class="italics">Inline Style</span> Examples</h4>
        <p>
            <p>
                Here are some <span class="bold">simple examples</span> 
                of how a <span class="highlight">span</span> can be 
                used to target 
                <span class="colored">specific content</span> 
                stylistically
                <span class="italics bold highlight colored">
                     (with a little help from some CSS).
                </span>
