        This text is not subscripted.

        <sub>
            This text is also subscripted.
        </sub>

        Note how all this text is all on the same line.

        That is because the &lt;sub&gt; element is an 
        inline element, so regardless of how we format 
        the code, it will all be on the same line on 
        the page (unless the line wraps).
